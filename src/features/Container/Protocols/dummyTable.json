To evaluate whether M7824 improves efficacy as a first-line (1L) therapy in combination with gemcitabine plus cisplatin for participants with locally advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC), a clinical proof-of-concept, randomized, controlled Phase II/III study in participants with BTC will be initiated. This is the first study of immuno-oncology therapy in 1L BTC to investigate the outcomes, dual primary endpoints, progression-free survival (PFS) time endpoints, and overall survival (OS). The key secondary endpoint is objective response. This study has an adaptive design that, without changing the inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrollment or randomization scheme, allows the expansion of the Phase II study into a Phase\u00a0III study by adding additional participants. The planned total sample size is 150 or 500 in addition to the safety run-in (i.e., 150 participants for the Phase II part and an additional 350 participants for the Phase III part). If the odds ratio in confirmed objective response is \u2265 1.6 or the hazard ratio (HR) in PFS is &lt; 0.75 at the interim analysis (IA) for adaptation decision with 150 participants, an additional 350 participants will be randomized. Assuming a true objective response difference of 15% and a true PFS hazard ratio (HR) of 0.65, this threshold is met with a probability of 93%, whereas if the true objective response difference is 0% and the PFS HR is 1.0 or worse, respectively, this threshold would be met with a probability of 19% or less. The planned first participant first dose is in Q3 2019. The planned analyses are shown in the table and figure below.
