          "Text":"1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY 1.1  Synopsis Protocol Title: A Phase III Double-Blind, Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Study Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of Capivasertib + Abiraterone Versus Placebo + Abiraterone as Treatment for Patients with De Novo Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC) Characterised by PTEN deficiency (CAPItello-281) Short Title: Capivasertib + Abiraterone as Treatment for Patients with Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Characterised by PTEN deficiency. Rationale: There is an important unmet medical need for treatments in the de novo mHSPC setting that are able to delay cancer progression and ultimately, death, particularly in patients whose tumours are characterised by PTEN deficiency.  Available nonclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the combined inhibition of serine\/threonine specific protein kinase (AKT) and the androgen receptor (AR) axis may improve treatment outcomes in mHSPC.  The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib and the androgen biosynthesis inhibitor abiraterone combined with a steroid, given on a background of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated mHSPC and PTEN-deficient tumours.

For Exploratory objectives and endpoints, see Section 3 of the CSP. Overall Design This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, global study, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of capivasertib versus placebo, when added to abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) on a background of ADT in participants with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC characterised by PTEN deficiency.  PTEN status will be confirmed by investigational IHC testing of tumour tissue at central laboratories.  A participant cannot be randomised until a valid PTEN IHC result indicates PTEN deficiency.  Participants will be recruited globally from approximately 30 countries and approximately 350 study sites in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and Asia (including China and Japan). Participants will be randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive either capivasertib or matching placebo, in combination with abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) on a background of ADT.  The randomisation scheme will be stratified on the following factors: Combination of volume of disease according to CHAARTED criteria* and presence of visceral metastases** (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease) * High volume (defined as the presence of visceral metastases or \u2265 4 bone lesions with \u2265 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis) versus low volume. ** For the purposes of this study, visceral metastases are defined by the list provided within the IWRS. Geographic location: North America, Western Europe, and Australia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and Asia. Disclosure Statement: This is a parallel-group treatment study with 2 arms that is participant, sponsor, and investigator blinded. Number of Participants: Approximately 5500 participants will be enrolled and screened to achieve a total of 1000 randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 treatment arms.  This is based on the planned number of 331 rPFS events that must be observed for the study to have 90% power to show a statistically significant difference in rPFS at the 2-sided 5% level, assuming a true treatment effect HR of 0.70 (see Section 9.2 for details). For regulatory submission purposes in China, the study will include approximately 150 randomised participants from sites in mainland China and those from Taiwan and Hong Kong accredited by the National Medical Product Administration (NMPA). Note: \u2018Enrolled' means a participant's, or their legally acceptable representative's, agreement to participate in a clinical study following completion of the informed consent process.  Potential participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the study, but are not randomly assigned in the study, are considered \u2018screen failures', unless otherwise specified by the protocol. Intervention Groups and Duration: Participants will receive oral treatment with capivasertib or matching placebo 400 mg twice daily (BD) 4 days on, 3 days off, until investigator-assessed disease progression by RECIST 1.1 or PCWG3 bone progression criteria, unacceptable toxicity, or the participant requests to stop the treatment.  Participants will also receive the approved oral dose of abiraterone (1000 mg once daily) with 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone daily.  All participants should also receive continuous ADT using either a LHRH agonist, a LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy. If either abiraterone or capivasertib\/placebo is discontinued prior to disease progression, participants may remain on the other drug at the investigator's discretion until disease progression or evidence of unacceptable toxicity. Data Monitoring Committee: An independent Data Monitoring Committee will assess the progress of the study at regular intervals.  This will include reviewing unblinded safety and tolerability data and the data from the interim efficacy analysis to provide a recommendation to AstraZeneca as to whether the study should continue unchanged, be stopped, or be modified in any way. Statistical Methods: The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be used as the primary population for reporting efficacy data and to summarise baseline characteristics.  This comprises all participants randomised into the study and will be analysed according to randomised treatment regardless of the treatment received (ITT principle).  Any important deviations from randomised treatment will be listed and considered when interpreting the efficacy data.  The Safety Analysis Set will be used as the primary population for reporting safety data.  This comprises all participants randomised into the study who receive at least 1 dose of capivasertib or placebo and will be analysed according to the treatment received.  If a participant receives at least 1 dose of capivasertib they will be included in the capivasertib arm for safety summaries. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy, measured by rPFS, of capivasertib + abiraterone versus placebo + abiraterone, both groups receiving continuous ADT.  The primary endpoint is rPFS in participants who have de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC characterised by PTEN deficiency who have received no prior pharmacotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery for metastatic prostate cancer other than that which is permitted by the protocol and may have been administered for a maximum of 3 months from start of ADT to randomisation in the study.  The effect of capivasertib versus placebo will be tested using a log rank test stratified by the randomisation stratification factors.  If there are insufficient events per strata, some strata will be collapsed following rules to be pre-specified in the SAP.  From a stratified Cox proportional hazards model (ties = Efron) the HR (capivasertib + abiraterone versus placebo + abiraterone) together with its corresponding 95% CI will be presented.  A HR < 1 will favour capivasertib + abiraterone. The key secondary endpoints of OS, TFST, SSE-FS, and TTPP will be tested following a MTP to preserve the overall type 1 error (familywise error rate) in the strong sense.  Each endpoint will have its own alpha spending function and will be tested according to the group-sequential Holm variable (GSHv) procedure (Ye et al 2013).  TFST will be analysed at the rPFS interim and final analyses.  OS, SSE-FS, and TTPP will be analysed at the final rPFS analysis and again, approximately 12 months after the final rPFS analysis. The primary endpoint of rPFS (based on investigator assessment using RECIST version 1.1 [soft tissue] and PCWG3 [bone]) will be tested in an interim analysis after 222 (22% maturity) rPFS events have occurred.  With 222 events, a significant result will be declared if the observed rPFS HR is 0.593 or better at this interim analysis with a 2-sided p-value < 0.0001 (approximate relative information fraction = 67%).  The interim analysis on rPFS will be incorporated into the MTP including the key secondary endpoints, which will be analysed using the same methodology specified for the primary endpoint. When the final rPFS analysis is performed it is estimated that approximately 331 (33%) of the 1000 participants will have progressed, according to the definition of rPFS: the time from randomisation to radiographic progression assessed by investigator using RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 (bone) criteria, or death. Safety and tolerability data will be summarised using appropriate descriptive statistics. 1.2  Schema Figure 1  Study Design None a  High volume is defined as the presence of visceral metastases or \u2265 4 bone lesions with \u2265 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis (Sweeney et al 2015).

Screening will be conducted in a 2-part process which must be completed within a 3-month period between the participant starting ADT and being randomised to study treatment.  This 3-month period may also include abiraterone treatment.  Screening Part 1 includes testing for PTEN status.  In Part 2, all remaining screening assessments should be performed, and must be completed within 28 days before randomisation.  Screening Part 1 and Part 2 each require a separate ICF.  Participants under screening in Part 2 must be given sufficient time to complete the 7-day BPI-SF and BFI diaries.  Table 2 provides the SoA for the study treatment and follow-up periods.

The modality of the cardiac function assessments must be consistent within subject ie, if echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment and a follow-up assessment if clinically indicated, then echocardiogram should also be used for subsequent scans.  Participants should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible. c Participants will be required to provide the most recently collected tumour sample (bone metastases or Fine Needle Aspirate [FNA] samples will not be accepted), collected as part of routine clinical practice.  Availability of a tumour sample is mandatory for all patients to enrol in the study for the determination of PTEN status by IHC.  A representative FFPE tissue block that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides must be provided, or, if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual and Pathology Testing Manual.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1; no additional slides will be collected for screening Part 1 or Part 2. d Optional tumour sample: FFPE block (preferred) or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections can be provided.  These slides will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/ or diagnostic test development.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual and Pathology Testing Manual. e Not applicable for China participants. f Eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) are required to provide an additional tumour sample FFPE block (preferred) or 20 (minimum 15) freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  This sample will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/or diagnostic test development.  Patients who provided optional tissue in screening Part 1 are exempt from this requirement.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. g Blood sample for determination of PSA.  Mandatory for all participants on study.  Samples to be collected both at screening and at Cycle 1, Day 1. h Tumour assessment will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a whole-body bone scan.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before randomisation, and ideally should be performed as close as possible to the start of study treatment. i BPI-SF and BFI baseline assessments to be completed by the participant in a consecutive 7-day period during screening (only after PTEN deficiency is confirmed) before randomisation (not required to be at site). j In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs\/SAEs must be reported.

None j Where possible and with consent, participants may be requested to provide a tumour biopsy at tumour progression. k Tumour assessment will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a whole-body bone scan.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) relative to the date of randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), regardless of discontinuation of study treatment (eg, discontinuation due to toxicity or clinical progression) or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy.  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged.  If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at the participant's scheduled visits.  It is important to follow the imaging assessment schedule as closely as possible; however, tumour assessment can be performed at any time when disease progression is clinically suspected.  For participants who have at least 2 new bone lesions appearing on the first post-baseline scan, confirmation of progression will be required by an additional bone scan showing 2 or more new lesions compared to the first post-baseline bone scan at least 6 weeks later (for further detail please see Appendix E). l For the BPI-SF and BFI, the C1D1 assessment is part of the 7-day diaries completed at screening (see Table 1). m The PRO-CTCAE will only be administered where a linguistically validated version exists for a country. n In addition to regular contacts at 12-week intervals, participants will be contacted in the 7 days following a specified date (data cut-off date) for survival analysis. o Participants will enter the PFS2 follow-up period once the participant has discontinued study treatment due to progressive disease by RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue lesions and\/or PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions.  In the survival follow-up period following PFS, all subsequent cancer therapies and vital status will be documented at least every 12 weeks until death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first.

          "Text":"1.1  Synopsis Protocol Title: A Phase III Double-Blind, Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Study Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of Capivasertib + Abiraterone Versus Placebo + Abiraterone as Treatment for Patients with De Novo Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC) Characterised by PTEN deficiency (CAPItello-281) Short Title: Capivasertib + Abiraterone as Treatment for Patients with Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Characterised by PTEN deficiency. Rationale: There is an important unmet medical need for treatments in the de novo mHSPC setting that are able to delay cancer progression and ultimately, death, particularly in patients whose tumours are characterised by PTEN deficiency.  Available nonclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the combined inhibition of serine\/threonine specific protein kinase (AKT) and the androgen receptor (AR) axis may improve treatment outcomes in mHSPC.

For Exploratory objectives and endpoints, see Section 3 of the CSP. Overall Design This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, global study, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of capivasertib versus placebo, when added to abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) on a background of ADT in participants with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC characterised by PTEN deficiency.  PTEN status will be confirmed by investigational IHC testing of tumour tissue at central laboratories.  A participant cannot be randomised until a valid PTEN IHC result indicates PTEN deficiency.  Participants will be recruited globally from approximately 30 countries and approximately 350 study sites in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and Asia (including China and Japan). Participants will be randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive either capivasertib or matching placebo, in combination with abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) on a background of ADT.  The randomisation scheme will be stratified on the following factors: Combination of volume of disease according to CHAARTED criteria* and presence of visceral metastases** (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease) * High volume (defined as the presence of visceral metastases or \u2265 4 bone lesions with \u2265 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis) versus low volume. ** For the purposes of this study, visceral metastases are defined by the list provided within the IWRS. Geographic location: North America, Western Europe, and Australia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and Asia. Disclosure Statement: This is a parallel-group treatment study with 2 arms that is participant, sponsor, and investigator blinded. Number of Participants: Approximately 5500 participants will be enrolled and screened to achieve a total of 1000 randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 treatment arms.  This is based on the planned number of 331 rPFS events that must be observed for the study to have 90% power to show a statistically significant difference in rPFS at the 2-sided 5% level, assuming a true treatment effect HR of 0.70 (see Section 9.2 for details). For regulatory submission purposes in China, the study will include approximately 150 randomised participants from sites in mainland China and those from Taiwan and Hong Kong accredited by the National Medical Product Administration (NMPA). Note: \u2018Enrolled' means a participant's, or their legally acceptable representative's, agreement to participate in a clinical study following completion of the informed consent process.  Potential participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the study, but are not randomly assigned in the study, are considered \u2018screen failures', unless otherwise specified by the protocol. Intervention Groups and Duration: Participants will receive oral treatment with capivasertib or matching placebo 400 mg twice daily (BD) 4 days on, 3 days off, until investigator-assessed disease progression by RECIST 1.1 or PCWG3 bone progression criteria, unacceptable toxicity, or the participant requests to stop the treatment.  Participants will also receive the approved oral dose of abiraterone (1000 mg once daily) with 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone daily.  All participants should also receive continuous ADT using either a LHRH agonist, a LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy. If either abiraterone or capivasertib\/placebo is discontinued prior to disease progression, participants may remain on the other drug at the investigator's discretion until disease progression or evidence of unacceptable toxicity. Data Monitoring Committee: An independent Data Monitoring Committee will assess the progress of the study at regular intervals.  This will include reviewing unblinded safety and tolerability data and the data from the interim efficacy analysis to provide a recommendation to AstraZeneca as to whether the study should continue unchanged, be stopped, or be modified in any way. Statistical Methods: The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be used as the primary population for reporting efficacy data and to summarise baseline characteristics.  This comprises all participants randomised into the study and will be analysed according to randomised treatment regardless of the treatment received (ITT principle).  Any important deviations from randomised treatment will be listed and considered when interpreting the efficacy data.  The Safety Analysis Set will be used as the primary population for reporting safety data.  This comprises all participants randomised into the study who receive at least 1 dose of capivasertib or placebo and will be analysed according to the treatment received.  If a participant receives at least 1 dose of capivasertib they will be included in the capivasertib arm for safety summaries. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy, measured by rPFS, of capivasertib + abiraterone versus placebo + abiraterone, both groups receiving continuous ADT.  The primary endpoint is rPFS in participants who have de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC characterised by PTEN deficiency who have received no prior pharmacotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery for metastatic prostate cancer other than that which is permitted by the protocol and may have been administered for a maximum of 3 months from start of ADT to randomisation in the study.  The effect of capivasertib versus placebo will be tested using a log rank test stratified by the randomisation stratification factors.  If there are insufficient events per strata, some strata will be collapsed following rules to be pre-specified in the SAP.  From a stratified Cox proportional hazards model (ties = Efron) the HR (capivasertib + abiraterone versus placebo + abiraterone) together with its corresponding 95% CI will be presented.  A HR < 1 will favour capivasertib + abiraterone. The key secondary endpoints of OS, TFST, SSE-FS, and TTPP will be tested following a MTP to preserve the overall type 1 error (familywise error rate) in the strong sense.  Each endpoint will have its own alpha spending function and will be tested according to the group-sequential Holm variable (GSHv) procedure (Ye et al 2013).  TFST will be analysed at the rPFS interim and final analyses.  OS, SSE-FS, and TTPP will be analysed at the final rPFS analysis and again, approximately 12 months after the final rPFS analysis. The primary endpoint of rPFS (based on investigator assessment using RECIST version 1.1 [soft tissue] and PCWG3 [bone]) will be tested in an interim analysis after 222 (22% maturity) rPFS events have occurred.  With 222 events, a significant result will be declared if the observed rPFS HR is 0.593 or better at this interim analysis with a 2-sided p-value < 0.0001 (approximate relative information fraction = 67%).  The interim analysis on rPFS will be incorporated into the MTP including the key secondary endpoints, which will be analysed using the same methodology specified for the primary endpoint. When the final rPFS analysis is performed it is estimated that approximately 331 (33%) of the 1000 participants will have progressed, according to the definition of rPFS: the time from randomisation to radiographic progression assessed by investigator using RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 (bone) criteria, or death. Safety and tolerability data will be summarised using appropriate descriptive statistics."

The modality of the cardiac function assessments must be consistent within subject ie, if echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment and a follow-up assessment if clinically indicated, then echocardiogram should also be used for subsequent scans.  Participants should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible. c Participants will be required to provide the most recently collected tumour sample (bone metastases or Fine Needle Aspirate [FNA] samples will not be accepted), collected as part of routine clinical practice.  Availability of a tumour sample is mandatory for all patients to enrol in the study for the determination of PTEN status by IHC.  A representative FFPE tissue block that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides must be provided, or, if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual and Pathology Testing Manual.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1; no additional slides will be collected for screening Part 1 or Part 2. d Optional tumour sample: FFPE block (preferred) or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections can be provided.  These slides will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/ or diagnostic test development.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual and Pathology Testing Manual. e Not applicable for China participants. f Eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) are required to provide an additional tumour sample FFPE block (preferred) or 20 (minimum 15) freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  This sample will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/or diagnostic test development.  Patients who provided optional tissue in screening Part 1 are exempt from this requirement.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. g Blood sample for determination of PSA.  Mandatory for all participants on study.  Samples to be collected both at screening and at Cycle 1, Day 1. h Tumour assessment will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a whole-body bone scan.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before randomisation, and ideally should be performed as close as possible to the start of study treatment. i BPI-SF and BFI baseline assessments to be completed by the participant in a consecutive 7-day period during screening (only after PTEN deficiency is confirmed) before randomisation (not required to be at site). j In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs\/SAEs must be reported.

          "Section":"2 INTRODUCTION",
          "Text":"2  INTRODUCTION Capivasertib (AZD5363), a novel pyrrolopyrimidine-derived compound, is a potent, selective inhibitor of the kinase activity of all 3 isoforms of AKT (Davies et al 2012).  AstraZeneca is developing capivasertib for use in combination with other anticancer agents for a range of therapeutic indications, including prostate cancer and breast cancer. The AKT serine\/threonine protein kinases (AKT1, AKT2, AKT3) are key downstream effectors of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway, mediating cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, and are activated in a wide range of malignancies (Lindsley 2010).  AKT activation in tumours is largely due to input from other signalling pathways upstream of AKT, including loss of PTEN function and mutations in the catalytic subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) (Yi and Lauring 2015). Investigators should be familiar with the current capivasertib Investigator's Brochure (IB). 2.1  Study Rationale This Phase 3 study is designed to compare capivasertib versus placebo, administered in combination with abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) and ADT as a treatment in patients with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC with tumour tissue characterised by PTEN deficiency.  The rationale for conducting the study is supported by the following: The important unmet medical need in this setting The capivasertib mechanism of action and nonclinical data with capivasertib Clinical data from a study with ipatasertib, an AKT inhibitor with a similar mechanism of action to capivasertib, given in combination with abiraterone in patients with prostate cancer. The background to the rationale is summarised below in Section 2.2. 2.2  Background Prostate cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer in men and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.  An estimated 1.3 million men worldwide were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018, accounting for 13% of the cancers diagnosed in men.  With an estimated 358,989 deaths in 2018, prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of death from cancer in men (6.7% of the total deaths from cancer in men) (Globocan 2018). In the advanced disease setting, ADT with either orchiectomy or medical castration with GnRH analogues is highly effective in shrinking tumour burden, decreasing PSA levels, and enhancing quality of life.  Recent studies demonstrated the benefits (including improved survival) in patients with mHSPC of adding docetaxel (Gravis et al 2016, James et al 2016, Sweeney et al 2015) or the androgen biosynthesis inhibitor abiraterone (Fizazi et al 2017, James et al 2017, Mottet et al 2018) to ADT.  Other NHAs, enzalutamide and apalutamide, have also demonstrated benefit in this population (Armstrong et al 2019, Chi et al 2019, Davis et al 2019).  Unfortunately, despite the benefits of these combination therapies, mHSPC inevitably progresses to a castration-resistant phenotype, which is not yet curable, with 90% of overall mortality attributable to the underlying malignant disease (Scher et al 2015). Patients with de novo mHSPC are at higher risk of progressing to a castration-resistant disease state than those with prostate cancer that has progressed to metastasis after treatment for what was initially localised or locally advanced disease (referred to as \u2018recurrent mHSPC'), as demonstrated by shorter median OS and time to castration resistance (Francini et al 2018, Francini et al 2019, Gravis et al 2015).  In addition, loss of PTEN gene expression in prostate cancer is associated with features of more aggressive disease and poor prognosis; patients with PTEN loss at diagnosis have increased risk of recurrence and poorer survival (Ahearn et al 2015, Chaux et al 2012, Cuzick et al 2013, Lotan et al 2016, Reid et al 2010).  Thus, there is an important unmet medical need for treatments in the de novo mHSPC setting that are able to delay cancer progression and ultimately, death, particularly in patients whose tumours are characterised by PTEN deficiency. In nonclinical studies, capivasertib inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines that represent both hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant disease settings (Davies et al 2012, Liu and Dong 2014, Marques et al 2015).  Single-agent capivasertib also inhibited the growth of both androgen-dependent and castrate-resistant prostate tumour xenograft models (Thomas et al 2013), genetically engineered prostate tumours (De Velasco et al 2016), and patient-derived xenografts (Marques et al 2015).  Sensitivity to capivasertib correlated with loss of PTEN expression.  Inhibition of tumour growth in prostate tumour models with PI3K pathway inhibitors and specifically with capivasertib alone resulted in upregulation of the AR and AR-mediated gene expression (Carver et al 2011, Mulholland et al 2011, Thomas et al 2013, Marques et al 2015).  Since the AR and PI3K\/AKT pathways cross regulate one another through reciprocal feedback (Carver et al 2011, Mulholland et al 2011), the combined inhibition of AKT and the AR axis in prostate cancer may provide greater benefit than targeting either pathway alone. These nonclinical data for capivasertib are supported by the results of the Phase II randomised ASTON MARTIN study with ipatasertib, an AKT inhibitor with a similar mechanism of action to capivasertib.  The results showed that ipatasertib given in combination with abiraterone prolonged rPFS compared with abiraterone alone in patients with mCRPC and PTEN-deficient tumours.  In the ITT population, median rPFS was 8.2 months for the ipatasertib 400 mg group compared with 6.4 months for placebo: HR, 0.75 (90% CI: 0.54, 1.05).  In the PTEN-deficient group, median rPFS was 11.5 months on ipatasertib 400 mg compared with 4.6 months on placebo: HR, 0.39 (90% CI: 0.22, 0.70) (de Bono et al 2019).  The combination of ipatasertib and abiraterone is under evaluation in mCRPC in an ongoing Phase 3 study (NCT03072238), which is now fully enrolled. A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of capivasertib is provided in the IB. 2.3  Benefit-Risk Assessment 2.3.1  Risk Assessment Based on nonclinical and clinical data available to date, the risks associated with capivasertib are as follows: Identified Risks: nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, dry skin, pruritus, decreased appetite Important Identified Risks: diarrhoea, rash, hyperglycaemia, hypersensitivity Important Potential Risk: QT prolongation Overall, in the monotherapy intermittent dosage pool of patients in previous studies (n = 229), 42.4% of the 229 patients had SAEs, 17% of the 229 had causally related SAEs, and 3.1% were reported with SAEs leading to death.  There were no capivasertib treatment-related deaths in this pool.  A total of 17.5% patients were discontinued due to AEs, and a total of 11.4% were discontinued due to AEs that were considered related to capivasertib treatment. Diarrhoea As of the data cut-off (DCO) date of October 2019, diarrhoea (all grades) has been observed in 79.9% of patients on capivasertib monotherapy (intermittent dosing); most (84%) of these events have been of Grade 2 or lower, managed by dose modifications and supportive care (eg, loperamide), and have only resulted in a 1.3% incidence of drug discontinuation. Hyperglycaemia Hyperglycaemia has been observed with AKT inhibitors.  AKT inhibitor-induced hyperglycaemia is associated with induction of liver glycogenolysis as well as reduction in peripheral glucose uptake.  This effect may be exaggerated by steroid therapy which is co-administered with abiraterone.  Based on currently available data from AstraZeneca-sponsored studies, hyperglycaemia due to capivasertib tends to be transient and reversible on cessation of treatment.  There is a trend of an increase in plasma glucose levels peaking at approximately 4 hours post-dose, generally returning towards baseline levels at 8 hours and beyond.  Dose discontinuations due to AEs of hyperglycaemia were uncommon in previous studies (0.9% of patients).  There were no data to suggest that the transient hyperglycaemia associated with capivasertib treatment had clinically important consequences. Patients with Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes who require insulin treatment, and\/or patients who have glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) \u2265 8.0% (63.9 mmol\/mol) at screening, will be excluded from the study.  Fasting glucose and HbA1c will be monitored throughout the study.  Hyperglycaemia will be mitigated by dose modifications as per toxicity management guidelines, including administration of antidiabetic agents (eg, metformin) when required. Potential Effect on QT Interval Inhibition of the PI3K signalling pathway has been identified as a potential cause of drug-induced long QT syndrome via an inhibition of cardiac potassium currents (IKr, IKs) and an increase of the cardiac late sodium current.  Based on nonclinical data available, QT prolongation has been noted as important potential risk with capivasertib.  QT prolongation has been observed with ADT.  The clinical data available to date do not support any clinically relevant trend of QT prolongation.  Based on a concentration-response modelling analysis, the estimated mean QTcF change from baseline was 4.0 ms (90% CI: 2.9, 5.1 ms) at the therapeutic dose (400 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off) and steady state geometric mean Cmax, which gives an approximate 4- to 5-fold margin to the level of regulatory concern for oncology drugs (20 ms) (Garnett et al 2018).  In AstraZeneca-sponsored clinical studies with capivasertib, there were no reports of sudden death, torsades de pointes, or seizures.  Further details on the risks are available in Section 6 of the IB \u2018Summary of data and guidance for the investigators'.  The study eligibility criteria take into account a potential impact on QT interval.  GnRH analogues\/ADT are known to be associated with QTc prolongation. Ongoing Phase Ib Study D3618C00002 Capivasertib is being evaluated in combination with abiraterone and GnRH analogues in an ongoing Phase Ib study (D3618C00002) in patients with mCRPC.  Following review of the starting dose of capivasertib (400 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off) in combination with standard dose abiraterone (+ prednisone), the study's safety review committee concluded that there were no dose-limiting toxicities observed to preclude further study of the combination at this dose level (see Section 4.3). Externally-Sponsored Research Studies There are 17 externally-sponsored research studies with capivasertib ongoing, completed, or terminated.  Of these 17, 8 are investigating capivasertib specifically and a further 9 are \u201cumbrella\/basket\u201d studies in which capivasertib is an option in a panel of investigational drugs.  Key safety information reported to AstraZeneca by externally-sponsored research sponsors has been incorporated in the IB. 2.3.2  Benefit Assessment Hormonal therapy targeting the androgen axis remains the mainstay of initial treatment for mHSPC and typically gives rapid disease response and control; however, resistance to hormonal therapies inevitably occurs with time and the cancer starts to progress. PTEN-deficient prostate cancer is associated with higher Gleason score, tumour stage, and poorer prognosis.  The AR and PI3K\/AKT signalling networks cross regulate each other, and the combination of capivasertib with an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor is anticipated to enhance efficacy in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer.  Clinical and nonclinical data with capivasertib support the hypothesis that AKT inhibition may be a valid treatment strategy for mHSPC.  Capivasertib has demonstrated clinical activity in several settings including patients with advanced AKT1 mutant solid tumours as monotherapy or in combination with other agents.  The experimental agent ipatasertib has the same mode of action, and in a randomised Phase II study (ASTON MARTIN) in patients with CRPC, demonstrated meaningful improvement in rPFS when added to abiraterone and ADT (de Bono et al 2019). 2.3.3  Overall Benefit-Risk Conclusion The emerging safety profile of capivasertib from nonclinical and early clinical studies has not identified risks that would preclude investigation in this setting.  The study design aims to minimise potential risks in several ways.  First, the protocol includes safety monitoring in excess of standard of care monitoring, with the intent of protecting participants involved in the study.  Furthermore, investigators will be provided with a safety management strategy for the management of key toxicities, and monitoring is in place for those risks deemed to be most likely or serious.  Thus, based upon the clinical and nonclinical safety profile of capivasertib, the limited life expectancy due to malignant disease, and the strength of the scientific hypothesis under evaluation, the benefit-risk assessment for this study supports treatment with capivasertib given in addition to standard androgen suppression therapy in the form of abiraterone and LHRH analogue\/surgical castration in patients with mHSPC. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected AEs of capivasertib may be found in the IB."

Further details on the risks are available in Section 6 of the IB \u2018Summary of data and guidance for the investigators'.  The study eligibility criteria take into account a potential impact on QT interval.  GnRH analogues\/ADT are known to be associated with QTc prolongation. Ongoing Phase Ib Study D3618C00002 Capivasertib is being evaluated in combination with abiraterone and GnRH analogues in an ongoing Phase Ib study (D3618C00002) in patients with mCRPC.  Following review of the starting dose of capivasertib (400 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off) in combination with standard dose abiraterone (+ prednisone), the study's safety review committee concluded that there were no dose-limiting toxicities observed to preclude further study of the combination at this dose level (see Section 4.3). Externally-Sponsored Research Studies There are 17 externally-sponsored research studies with capivasertib ongoing, completed, or terminated.  Of these 17, 8 are investigating capivasertib specifically and a further 9 are \u201cumbrella\/basket\u201d studies in which capivasertib is an option in a panel of investigational drugs.  Key safety information reported to AstraZeneca by externally-sponsored research sponsors has been incorporated in the IB. 2.3.2  Benefit Assessment Hormonal therapy targeting the androgen axis remains the mainstay of initial treatment for mHSPC and typically gives rapid disease response and control; however, resistance to hormonal therapies inevitably occurs with time and the cancer starts to progress. PTEN-deficient prostate cancer is associated with higher Gleason score, tumour stage, and poorer prognosis.  The AR and PI3K\/AKT signalling networks cross regulate each other, and the combination of capivasertib with an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor is anticipated to enhance efficacy in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer.  Clinical and nonclinical data with capivasertib support the hypothesis that AKT inhibition may be a valid treatment strategy for mHSPC.  Capivasertib has demonstrated clinical activity in several settings including patients with advanced AKT1 mutant solid tumours as monotherapy or in combination with other agents.  The experimental agent ipatasertib has the same mode of action, and in a randomised Phase II study (ASTON MARTIN) in patients with CRPC, demonstrated meaningful improvement in rPFS when added to abiraterone and ADT (de Bono et al 2019). 2.3.3  Overall Benefit-Risk Conclusion The emerging safety profile of capivasertib from nonclinical and early clinical studies has not identified risks that would preclude investigation in this setting.  The study design aims to minimise potential risks in several ways.  First, the protocol includes safety monitoring in excess of standard of care monitoring, with the intent of protecting participants involved in the study.  Furthermore, investigators will be provided with a safety management strategy for the management of key toxicities, and monitoring is in place for those risks deemed to be most likely or serious.  Thus, based upon the clinical and nonclinical safety profile of capivasertib, the limited life expectancy due to malignant disease, and the strength of the scientific hypothesis under evaluation, the benefit-risk assessment for this study supports treatment with capivasertib given in addition to standard androgen suppression therapy in the form of abiraterone and LHRH analogue\/surgical castration in patients with mHSPC. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected AEs of capivasertib may be found in the IB."

          "Text":"2.3.1  Risk Assessment Based on nonclinical and clinical data available to date, the risks associated with capivasertib are as follows: Identified Risks: nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, dry skin, pruritus, decreased appetite Important Identified Risks: diarrhoea, rash, hyperglycaemia, hypersensitivity Important Potential Risk: QT prolongation Overall, in the monotherapy intermittent dosage pool of patients in previous studies (n = 229), 42.4% of the 229 patients had SAEs, 17% of the 229 had causally related SAEs, and 3.1% were reported with SAEs leading to death.  There were no capivasertib treatment-related deaths in this pool.  A total of 17.5% patients were discontinued due to AEs, and a total of 11.4% were discontinued due to AEs that were considered related to capivasertib treatment. Diarrhoea As of the data cut-off (DCO) date of October 2019, diarrhoea (all grades) has been observed in 79.9% of patients on capivasertib monotherapy (intermittent dosing); most (84%) of these events have been of Grade 2 or lower, managed by dose modifications and supportive care (eg, loperamide), and have only resulted in a 1.3% incidence of drug discontinuation. Hyperglycaemia Hyperglycaemia has been observed with AKT inhibitors.  AKT inhibitor-induced hyperglycaemia is associated with induction of liver glycogenolysis as well as reduction in peripheral glucose uptake.  This effect may be exaggerated by steroid therapy which is co-administered with abiraterone.  Based on currently available data from AstraZeneca-sponsored studies, hyperglycaemia due to capivasertib tends to be transient and reversible on cessation of treatment.  There is a trend of an increase in plasma glucose levels peaking at approximately 4 hours post-dose, generally returning towards baseline levels at 8 hours and beyond.  Dose discontinuations due to AEs of hyperglycaemia were uncommon in previous studies (0.9% of patients).  There were no data to suggest that the transient hyperglycaemia associated with capivasertib treatment had clinically important consequences. Patients with Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes who require insulin treatment, and\/or patients who have glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) \u2265 8.0% (63.9 mmol\/mol) at screening, will be excluded from the study.  Fasting glucose and HbA1c will be monitored throughout the study.  Hyperglycaemia will be mitigated by dose modifications as per toxicity management guidelines, including administration of antidiabetic agents (eg, metformin) when required. Potential Effect on QT Interval Inhibition of the PI3K signalling pathway has been identified as a potential cause of drug-induced long QT syndrome via an inhibition of cardiac potassium currents (IKr, IKs) and an increase of the cardiac late sodium current.  Based on nonclinical data available, QT prolongation has been noted as important potential risk with capivasertib.  QT prolongation has been observed with ADT.  The clinical data available to date do not support any clinically relevant trend of QT prolongation.  Based on a concentration-response modelling analysis, the estimated mean QTcF change from baseline was 4.0 ms (90% CI: 2.9, 5.1 ms) at the therapeutic dose (400 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off) and steady state geometric mean Cmax, which gives an approximate 4- to 5-fold margin to the level of regulatory concern for oncology drugs (20 ms) (Garnett et al 2018).

          "Text":"4  STUDY DESIGN 4.1  Overall Design This Phase III, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, global study is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of capivasertib versus placebo when added to abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) on a background of ADT in patients with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC characterised by PTEN deficiency. Participants will be recruited globally from approximately 30 countries and approximately 350 study sites in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and Asia (including China and Japan). Approximately 5500 participants will be enrolled and screened to achieve a total of 1000 randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 treatment arms.  For regulatory submission purposes in China, the study will include approximately 150 randomised participants from sites in mainland China and those from Taiwan and Hong Kong accredited by the National Medical Product Administration (NMPA). Screening will be conducted in a 2-part process (see Figure 2), which must be completed within a 3-month period between the participant starting ADT and being randomised to study treatment.  In the 3-month period between screening Part 1 and randomisation, participants may be receiving abiraterone as well as ADT.  Part 1 will include those eligibility criteria marked with an asterisk (*) in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, and testing for PTEN status.  In Part 2, all remaining screening assessments will be performed, and must be completed within 28 days before randomisation.  The assessments to be performed at screening are shown in the SoA (Table 1). Figure 2  Two-part Screening Process None Table 1 shows the assessments to be completed in screening Parts 1 and 2. Eligible participants will have histologically confirmed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma, without small-cell features.  PTEN status is confirmed by IHC via central testing of tumour tissue using an Investigational Use Only (IUO) assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, USA).  For screening Part 1, patients are required to provide a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour sample, collected as part of routine clinical practice, for central testing.  This should preferably be a tissue block that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides, or if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides from the same block.  In addition, for screening Part 1 an optional tumour sample (FFPE block [preferred] or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections) can be provided.  These slides will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/or diagnostic test development.  Participants who provide this optional sample in Part 1 do not need to provide additional tumour sample for screening Part 2.  For screening Part 2, eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) will be required to provide an additional tumour sample FFPE block (preferred) or 20 (minimum 15) freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  This sample will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/or diagnostic test development.  Further details on tissue specifications are outlined in the Laboratory Manual and the Pathology Testing Manual as well as in Section 8.6.1.  A patient cannot be randomised until a valid, central laboratory tested PTEN IHC result indicates PTEN deficiency.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1; no additional slides will be collected for screening Part 2. Blood samples for analysis of ctDNA and other circulating biomarkers will also be collected and analysed (not applicable for China patients). Approximately 1000 participants will be randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive either capivasertib or placebo, in combination with abiraterone on a background of ADT.  It is expected that approximately 5500 potential participants will be screened.  The screen failure rate is estimated on the following assumptions: PTEN deficiency prevalence of 21% (screen failure rate of 79%), as well as a further 15% screen failure for other reasons (eg, informed consent\/ eligibility criteria\/PTEN IHC test failure rate).  Participants will receive oral treatment with capivasertib or placebo BD (4 days on and 3 days off) until progression or discontinuation.  Participants will also receive the approved oral dose of abiraterone (1000 mg once daily) with 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone daily.  All participants should also receive continuous ADT using either a LHRH agonist, a LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy. The randomisation scheme will be stratified on the following factors: Combination of volume of disease according to CHAARTED criteria and presence of visceral metastases (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease) Geographic location: North America, Western Europe, and Australia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and Asia. High volume disease is defined as the presence of either visceral metastases (or \u2265 4 bone metastases with \u2265 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis (Sweeney et al 2015).  For the purposes of this study, visceral metastases are defined by the list provided within the IWRS. An IDMC will assess the progress of the study at regular intervals.  This will include reviewing unblinded safety and tolerability data and the data from the interim efficacy analysis to provide a recommendation to AstraZeneca as to whether the study should continue unchanged, be stopped, or be modified in any way. Section 6.7 describes treatment intervention after the end of the study. 4.2  Scientific Rationale for Study Design Choice of Background Therapy At the time of initiation of this study, the Category 1 recommended treatment options for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer in the US include ADT in combination with docetaxel, abiraterone (+ prednisone), apalutamide, or enzalutamide, since these combinations have all reported OS improvement over ADT alone in randomised Phase III studies in this setting (NCCN 2019).  Alternatives include ADT with addition of radiation therapy (for low volume mHSPC) or ADT with abiraterone with methylprednisolone (Category 2B).  The European Association of Urology (EAU) treatment guidelines currently recommend a choice between abiraterone and chemotherapy as systemic treatment in addition to a background of ADT, irrespective of risk status (EAU guidelines 2019).  In patients with previously untreated mHSPC, docetaxel or abiraterone treatment resulted in an OS of 57.6 and 53.3 months respectively, and patients progress to mCRPC on average 33 months after start of treatment Fizazi et al 2017, Sweeney et al 2015).  Since mHSPC patients inevitably progress to a castration-resistant phenotype, therapeutic interventions that are able to delay the time to disease progression would address an important unmet medical need.  Although currently incurable, the disease is more amenable to intervention and a targeted treatment approach may bring additional benefits over AR-based treatments alone (Fizazi et al 2017). There is an increasing focus on the development of molecularly-targeted agents for individualised treatment in prostate cancer, eg, PARP inhibitors in patients with DNA repair pathway alteration (Mateo et al 2015, Mateo et al 2019, Hussain et al 2019).  Activation of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway is common in prostate cancer, predominantly due to PTEN loss (Robinson et al 2015, Abida et al 2017), and there is a reciprocal relationship between this pathway and the AR pathway, such that inhibition of one leads to upregulation of the other (Carver et al 2011).  Of note, PTEN loss has been shown to be an indicator of poor prognosis in prostate cancer; PTEN loss was associated with early biochemical recurrence, extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle involvement, and poorer cause-specific and overall survival, based on samples predominantly from patients with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer (Krohn et al 2012, Reid et al 2010, Troyer et al 2015). Evidence from clinical studies is emerging for the benefits of AKT inhibition in combination with abiraterone in the treatment of prostate cancer; eg, the Phase II ASTON MARTIN study of ipatasertib in combination with abiraterone in patients with mCRPC prolonged rPFS compared with abiraterone alone, especially in patients with PTEN-deficient tumours: median rPFS was 11.5 versus 4.6 months (de Bono et al 2019).  Since the proof of concept for AKT inhibition in a metastatic prostate cancer setting was obtained for ipatasertib in combination with abiraterone, enrolment into the present study is restricted to patients for whom abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) plus ADT is considered the optimal treatment approach by the treating investigator; patients requiring another treatment modality such as docetaxel or radiotherapy are not eligible. In summary, although abiraterone is an approved therapy and is a recommended treatment option for patients with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC in current evidence-based guidelines, there is still a significant unmet medical need in this population.  In particular, patients with PTEN-deficient tumours may experience improved treatment outcomes from the addition of a molecularly targeted agent, including those that specifically inhibit the PI3K\/AKT pathway.  Therefore, addition of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib to standard abiraterone therapy could improve treatment outcomes in mHSPC patients with PTEN-deficient tumours and delay the development of castration resistance. Abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA\u00ae) is converted in vivo to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor.  Specifically, abiraterone selectively inhibits the enzyme 17\u03b1 hydroxylase\/C17,20 lyase (CYP17).  This enzyme is expressed in, and is required for, androgen biosynthesis in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumour tissues.  CYP17 catalyses the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone into testosterone precursors, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione, respectively, by 17\u03b1-hydroxylation and cleavage of the C17,20 bond.  CYP17 inhibition also results in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals.  Abiraterone was first approved (in combination with prednisone) for the treatment of mCRPC.  The indication has since been extended to include the treatment of newly diagnosed high-risk mHSPC (ZYTIGA Prescribing Information 2019, Zytiga SmPC 2019). The approval of abiraterone in mHSPC was supported by 2 large randomised controlled studies demonstrating the survival and other patient-relevant benefits of abiraterone given in addition to ADT: STAMPEDE (Arm G) (James et al 2017) and LATITUDE (Fizazi et al 2017, Fizazi et al 2019).  The LATITUDE study (unlike STAMPEDE) required all participants to have high-risk mHSPC, defined by having at least 2 of the following: Gleason score of \u2265 8, \u2265 3 bone metastases, or the presence of visceral metastases.  The reduction in the risk of death was nearly identical between the two studies, with a HR of 0.62, also confirmed in a meta-analysis.  Furthermore, post hoc analyses of STAMPEDE demonstrated that abiraterone achieved positive outcomes in men with mHSPC (including rPFS and OS) regardless of low or high burden of disease.  The definition of \u2018low volume' versus \u2018high volume' disease was based on the CHAARTED criteria (presence of either visceral metastases or > 3 bone metastases).  Risk status (\u2018low risk' vs \u2018high risk') was defined using the LATITUDE criteria (Hoyle et al 2019; Sweeney et al 2015, Fizazi et al 2017).  In addition to the effects on failure-free survival and OS in STAMPEDE, significant benefits of add-on abiraterone were also seen for PROs in LATITUDE, including progression of pain, prostate cancer symptoms, fatigue, functional decline, and overall HRQoL (Chi et al 2018). Based on the studies and clinical practice guidelines discussed above, abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) plus ADT combination therapy currently is a recommended standard-of-care first-line option for the treatment of men with de novo mHSPC, irrespective of risk status or disease volume (EAU guidelines 2019, Mottet et al 2018, NCCN 2019, Parker et al 2015, Parker et al 2017). Study Population The study population is associated with considerable unmet medical need, as described in Section 2.2. The rationale for the inclusion of participants with mHSPC without high-risk features in this study is based on the analyses from the STAMPEDE study, which demonstrated that abiraterone achieved positive efficacy outcomes for both rPFS and OS in the target patient population, regardless of risk status (James et al 2017).  In addition, as noted above, classifying patients with prostate cancer for treatment based on risk status is not distinguished within treatment guidelines, and is not routinely done in the clinic. Only adenocarcinomas without small-cell histology are allowed; this is consistent with the LATITUDE study (Fizazi et al 2017), which was the primary basis for the approval of abiraterone in mHSPC. The presence of metastatic disease will be confirmed using standard imaging techniques that are widely used in the staging of prostate cancer in routine clinical practice, with RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 principles adopted for assessment of metastatic lesions. Only patients with ECOG performance status 0 or 1 are eligible, in line with guidelines recommending that abiraterone should be offered only to patients with ECOG status 0 or 1. The use of mild opioid analgesics for cancer-related pain, bisphosphonates and denosumab for management of bone-related metastases, LHRH analogues (ie, ADT) to maintain testosterone < 50 ng\/dL, conventional multivitamins and selenium, prednisone dose increases and eplerenone to manage refractory mineralocorticoid-related toxicities, transfusions and haematopoietic growth factors will all be permitted during the study.  However, where possible, these will be kept at a stable dose to allow accurate characterisation of the capivasertib treatment effect. Stratification Factors The randomisation scheme will be stratified based a combination of volume of disease and presence of visceral metastases, and also geographic location (as described in Section 4.1). Volume of disease as determined by the CHAARTED criteria is considered a key prognostic factor in prostate cancer.  High volume disease is defined as the presence of visceral metastases or \u2265 4 bone lesions with \u2265 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis.  Although abiraterone has been shown to provide benefit to patients with mHSPC in each risk status and volume subgroup, the overall prognosis as measured by median failure-free survival, PFS, and OS was markedly shorter in patients with high disease volume (Hoyle et al 2019).  This prognostic effect is further supported by analyses of other agents in mHSPC (Sweeney et al 2015, Stenzl et al 2019). Presence of visceral metastases is a known prognostic factor in prostate cancer and was incorporated into both the LATITUDE risk and CHAARTED disease volume criteria.  However, visceral tumour sites (eg, lung and liver metastases) were shown to be independently related to worse prognosis in a meta-analysis of 8802 men with prostate cancer (Halabi at al 2016).  The combination of volume of disease (high versus low) according to CHAARTED criteria and presence of visceral metastases results in a stratification factor with 3 levels (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease), as according to the definition, patients with low disease volume would not have visceral metastases.  For the purposes of this study, visceral metastases are defined by the list provided within the IWRS. The geographic split of Western Europe, Australia plus United States, Latin America plus Eastern Europe, and Asia was chosen to account for possible differences in PSA screening, and healthcare accessibility and quality in different regions that could affect both the primary treatment outcome and post study (eg, OS) endpoints. Study Endpoints The definition of rPFS (see Section 8.1.2.1) is considered to be consistent with EMA guidance in the prostate cancer-specific appendix to the Guideline on the Evaluation of Anticancer Medicinal Products in Man (EMA 2015) which recognises PFS as an acceptable primary endpoint.  PFS is also listed in the FDA's table of surrogate endpoints and has supported prior approvals in prostate cancer (FDA 2019).  Reducing the risk of radiographic progression is of clinical importance given the strong positive correlation reported for PFS and OS in patients with mCRPC.  Also, a recent study of enzalutamide in patients with mHSPC (ARCHES; Armstrong et al 2019) which was the basis of the recent FDA approval and positive opinion adopted by the CHMP for this indication, utilised rPFS as the primary endpoint.  The Phase III study supporting the FDA approval of apalutamide used rPFS as a dual primary endpoint (with OS) (Chi et al 2019). The median OS for the mHSPC patient population treated with ADT and abiraterone is over 5 years.  It is considered that an unfeasibly large and long study (more than 4000 patients and a study duration of over 11 years) would be required to obtain sufficient statistical power to detect OS differences in a reasonable timeframe.  However, the study population will be followed up after the primary analysis for rPFS for longer term endpoints, including OS. The key secondary efficacy endpoints for this study have been widely adopted in clinical studies in patients with prostate cancer and overall, are considered to represent the most clinically meaningful events for patients.  Prostate cancer typically metastasises to bone and is associated with risk of pathological fractures, spinal cord compression and severe pain with detrimental impact on quality of life.  Reducing the risk of developing symptomatic skeletal-related events and delaying the onset of pain are considered highly clinically relevant endpoints in the context of prostate cancer. The study includes several PRO endpoints, of which AstraZeneca considers the measurement of pain as the most relevant measure of the patient experience with mHSPC, and will be an alpha-controlled secondary endpoint, defined based on the BPI-SF worst pain (Item 3) and analgesic use.  Additionally, a comprehensive evaluation of fatigue, symptoms, impacts, treatment tolerability, and HRQoL will provide a totality of PRO evidence. 4.3  Justification for Dose Several doses and schedules have been investigated for capivasertib.  In the capivasertib clinical programme as of 04 October 2019 (the DCO for the current IB), approximately 1150 patients had been exposed to capivasertib as monotherapy or in combination with other agents: approximately 480 patients in AstraZeneca-sponsored studies and 672 in Investigator-sponsored studies.  More detailed information may be found in the IB. The recommended regimen for monotherapy (480 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off) was selected based on pharmacodynamic parameters from tumour biopsies, PK data, and clinical safety.  The recommended regimen of capivasertib with paclitaxel or with fulvestrant is 400 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off. Clinical studies with the AKT inhibitor ipatasertib have demonstrated efficacy and favourable tolerability in different tumour types at the same dose (400 mg QD continuously), namely in TNBC with the paclitaxel combination (LOTUS study; Kim et al 2017) and in prostate cancer with the abiraterone combination (ASTON MARTIN Phase II study; de Bono et al 2019). Therefore, the capivasertib dose regimen (400 mg BD, 4 days on, 3 days off), which has demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in randomised Phase II studies in metastatic TNBC (PAKT; Schmid et al 2020) and HR+ advanced breast cancer (FAKTION; Jones et al 2019), is hypothesised to be effective and tolerable also in prostate cancer. Since no major influence of gender or age has been observed on the PK of capivasertib and the risk of PK interactions between capivasertib and abiraterone + prednisone\/prednisolone in combination with GnRH analogues is low, similar systemic exposure is expected in the prostate cancer population as in the breast cancer populations. The conversion of abiraterone acetate to its active metabolite abiraterone is likely through esterase activity and is not CYP-mediated.  Abiraterone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and capivasertib is a direct and time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  However, co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of abiraterone.  Abiraterone has the potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and to a lesser extent CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4\/5.  Capivasertib is primarily metabolised by UGT2B7 and CYP3A4.  In vitro, abiraterone and its major metabolites were shown to inhibit the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1.  There are no clinical data available to confirm transporter-based interactions. Clinically relevant interactions between capivasertib and prednisone\/prednisolone are unlikely.  Drugs which inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of corticosteroids.  The strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%.  However, capivasertib is not a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 based on in vitro results and PBPK simulations.  Glucocorticoids are moderate inducers of CYP3A4, but capivasertib is unlikely to be a sensitive substrate of CYP3A4.  The risk for drug-drug interactions between capivasertib and GnRH analogues is low.  These drugs are peptides, metabolised by peptidases, so it is unlikely that they would be affected by CYP450 inhibitors. The ongoing Phase Ib Study D3618C00002 in patients with mCRPC is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and PK of capivasertib in combination with abiraterone (+ prednisone\/ prednisolone) and GnRH analogues.  After review of the first dose level (400 mg BD, 4 days on, 3 days off) in combination with standard dose abiraterone + prednisone in n=8 patients with heavily pretreated mCPRC, the safety review committee concluded that there were no dose-limiting toxicities observed to preclude further study of the combination at this dose level.  The capivasertib PK was as predicted from previous studies where capivasertib was given as monotherapy.  Thus, the capivasertib dosing regimen of 400 mg BD, 4 days on, 3 days off, is selected for the present study in combination with abiraterone and ADT.  This regimen is also being examined in the Phase 3 breast cancer programme (CAPItello-290\/D3614C00001 and CAPItello-291\/D3615C00001, in combination with paclitaxel or with fulvestrant, respectively). Guidelines for modification of the capivasertib\/placebo dose in the present study are provided in Section 6.6. 4.4  End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study when they have completed all phases of the study including their last scheduled visit or their last scheduled procedure in the SoA (Table 2). The end of the study is defined as the date of last expected visit\/contact of the last participant undergoing the study."

          "Text":"4.1  Overall Design This Phase III, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, global study is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of capivasertib versus placebo when added to abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) on a background of ADT in patients with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC characterised by PTEN deficiency. Participants will be recruited globally from approximately 30 countries and approximately 350 study sites in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and Asia (including China and Japan). Approximately 5500 participants will be enrolled and screened to achieve a total of 1000 randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 treatment arms.  For regulatory submission purposes in China, the study will include approximately 150 randomised participants from sites in mainland China and those from Taiwan and Hong Kong accredited by the National Medical Product Administration (NMPA). Screening will be conducted in a 2-part process (see Figure 2), which must be completed within a 3-month period between the participant starting ADT and being randomised to study treatment.  In the 3-month period between screening Part 1 and randomisation, participants may be receiving abiraterone as well as ADT.  Part 1 will include those eligibility criteria marked with an asterisk (*) in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, and testing for PTEN status.  In Part 2, all remaining screening assessments will be performed, and must be completed within 28 days before randomisation.  The assessments to be performed at screening are shown in the SoA (Table 1). Figure 2  Two-part Screening Process None Table 1 shows the assessments to be completed in screening Parts 1 and 2. Eligible participants will have histologically confirmed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma, without small-cell features.  PTEN status is confirmed by IHC via central testing of tumour tissue using an Investigational Use Only (IUO) assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, USA).  For screening Part 1, patients are required to provide a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour sample, collected as part of routine clinical practice, for central testing.  This should preferably be a tissue block that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides, or if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides from the same block.  In addition, for screening Part 1 an optional tumour sample (FFPE block [preferred] or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections) can be provided.  These slides will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/or diagnostic test development.  Participants who provide this optional sample in Part 1 do not need to provide additional tumour sample for screening Part 2.  For screening Part 2, eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) will be required to provide an additional tumour sample FFPE block (preferred) or 20 (minimum 15) freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  This sample will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/or diagnostic test development.  Further details on tissue specifications are outlined in the Laboratory Manual and the Pathology Testing Manual as well as in Section 8.6.1.  A patient cannot be randomised until a valid, central laboratory tested PTEN IHC result indicates PTEN deficiency.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1; no additional slides will be collected for screening Part 2. Blood samples for analysis of ctDNA and other circulating biomarkers will also be collected and analysed (not applicable for China patients). Approximately 1000 participants will be randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive either capivasertib or placebo, in combination with abiraterone on a background of ADT.  It is expected that approximately 5500 potential participants will be screened.  The screen failure rate is estimated on the following assumptions: PTEN deficiency prevalence of 21% (screen failure rate of 79%), as well as a further 15% screen failure for other reasons (eg, informed consent\/ eligibility criteria\/PTEN IHC test failure rate).  Participants will receive oral treatment with capivasertib or placebo BD (4 days on and 3 days off) until progression or discontinuation.  Participants will also receive the approved oral dose of abiraterone (1000 mg once daily) with 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone daily.  All participants should also receive continuous ADT using either a LHRH agonist, a LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy. The randomisation scheme will be stratified on the following factors: Combination of volume of disease according to CHAARTED criteria and presence of visceral metastases (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease) Geographic location: North America, Western Europe, and Australia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and Asia. High volume disease is defined as the presence of either visceral metastases (or \u2265 4 bone metastases with \u2265 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis (Sweeney et al 2015).  For the purposes of this study, visceral metastases are defined by the list provided within the IWRS. An IDMC will assess the progress of the study at regular intervals.  This will include reviewing unblinded safety and tolerability data and the data from the interim efficacy analysis to provide a recommendation to AstraZeneca as to whether the study should continue unchanged, be stopped, or be modified in any way. Section 6.7 describes treatment intervention after the end of the study."

          "Section":"4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design",
          "Text":"4.2  Scientific Rationale for Study Design Choice of Background Therapy At the time of initiation of this study, the Category 1 recommended treatment options for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer in the US include ADT in combination with docetaxel, abiraterone (+ prednisone), apalutamide, or enzalutamide, since these combinations have all reported OS improvement over ADT alone in randomised Phase III studies in this setting (NCCN 2019).  Alternatives include ADT with addition of radiation therapy (for low volume mHSPC) or ADT with abiraterone with methylprednisolone (Category 2B).  The European Association of Urology (EAU) treatment guidelines currently recommend a choice between abiraterone and chemotherapy as systemic treatment in addition to a background of ADT, irrespective of risk status (EAU guidelines 2019).  In patients with previously untreated mHSPC, docetaxel or abiraterone treatment resulted in an OS of 57.6 and 53.3 months respectively, and patients progress to mCRPC on average 33 months after start of treatment Fizazi et al 2017, Sweeney et al 2015).  Since mHSPC patients inevitably progress to a castration-resistant phenotype, therapeutic interventions that are able to delay the time to disease progression would address an important unmet medical need.  Although currently incurable, the disease is more amenable to intervention and a targeted treatment approach may bring additional benefits over AR-based treatments alone (Fizazi et al 2017). There is an increasing focus on the development of molecularly-targeted agents for individualised treatment in prostate cancer, eg, PARP inhibitors in patients with DNA repair pathway alteration (Mateo et al 2015, Mateo et al 2019, Hussain et al 2019).  Activation of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway is common in prostate cancer, predominantly due to PTEN loss (Robinson et al 2015, Abida et al 2017), and there is a reciprocal relationship between this pathway and the AR pathway, such that inhibition of one leads to upregulation of the other (Carver et al 2011).  Of note, PTEN loss has been shown to be an indicator of poor prognosis in prostate cancer; PTEN loss was associated with early biochemical recurrence, extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle involvement, and poorer cause-specific and overall survival, based on samples predominantly from patients with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer (Krohn et al 2012, Reid et al 2010, Troyer et al 2015). Evidence from clinical studies is emerging for the benefits of AKT inhibition in combination with abiraterone in the treatment of prostate cancer; eg, the Phase II ASTON MARTIN study of ipatasertib in combination with abiraterone in patients with mCRPC prolonged rPFS compared with abiraterone alone, especially in patients with PTEN-deficient tumours: median rPFS was 11.5 versus 4.6 months (de Bono et al 2019).  Since the proof of concept for AKT inhibition in a metastatic prostate cancer setting was obtained for ipatasertib in combination with abiraterone, enrolment into the present study is restricted to patients for whom abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) plus ADT is considered the optimal treatment approach by the treating investigator; patients requiring another treatment modality such as docetaxel or radiotherapy are not eligible. In summary, although abiraterone is an approved therapy and is a recommended treatment option for patients with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC in current evidence-based guidelines, there is still a significant unmet medical need in this population.  In particular, patients with PTEN-deficient tumours may experience improved treatment outcomes from the addition of a molecularly targeted agent, including those that specifically inhibit the PI3K\/AKT pathway.  Therefore, addition of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib to standard abiraterone therapy could improve treatment outcomes in mHSPC patients with PTEN-deficient tumours and delay the development of castration resistance. Abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA\u00ae) is converted in vivo to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor.  Specifically, abiraterone selectively inhibits the enzyme 17\u03b1 hydroxylase\/C17,20 lyase (CYP17).  This enzyme is expressed in, and is required for, androgen biosynthesis in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumour tissues.  CYP17 catalyses the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone into testosterone precursors, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione, respectively, by 17\u03b1-hydroxylation and cleavage of the C17,20 bond.  CYP17 inhibition also results in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals.  Abiraterone was first approved (in combination with prednisone) for the treatment of mCRPC.  The indication has since been extended to include the treatment of newly diagnosed high-risk mHSPC (ZYTIGA Prescribing Information 2019, Zytiga SmPC 2019). The approval of abiraterone in mHSPC was supported by 2 large randomised controlled studies demonstrating the survival and other patient-relevant benefits of abiraterone given in addition to ADT: STAMPEDE (Arm G) (James et al 2017) and LATITUDE (Fizazi et al 2017, Fizazi et al 2019).  The LATITUDE study (unlike STAMPEDE) required all participants to have high-risk mHSPC, defined by having at least 2 of the following: Gleason score of \u2265 8, \u2265 3 bone metastases, or the presence of visceral metastases.  The reduction in the risk of death was nearly identical between the two studies, with a HR of 0.62, also confirmed in a meta-analysis.  Furthermore, post hoc analyses of STAMPEDE demonstrated that abiraterone achieved positive outcomes in men with mHSPC (including rPFS and OS) regardless of low or high burden of disease.  The definition of \u2018low volume' versus \u2018high volume' disease was based on the CHAARTED criteria (presence of either visceral metastases or > 3 bone metastases).  Risk status (\u2018low risk' vs \u2018high risk') was defined using the LATITUDE criteria (Hoyle et al 2019; Sweeney et al 2015, Fizazi et al 2017).  In addition to the effects on failure-free survival and OS in STAMPEDE, significant benefits of add-on abiraterone were also seen for PROs in LATITUDE, including progression of pain, prostate cancer symptoms, fatigue, functional decline, and overall HRQoL (Chi et al 2018). Based on the studies and clinical practice guidelines discussed above, abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) plus ADT combination therapy currently is a recommended standard-of-care first-line option for the treatment of men with de novo mHSPC, irrespective of risk status or disease volume (EAU guidelines 2019, Mottet et al 2018, NCCN 2019, Parker et al 2015, Parker et al 2017). Study Population The study population is associated with considerable unmet medical need, as described in Section 2.2. The rationale for the inclusion of participants with mHSPC without high-risk features in this study is based on the analyses from the STAMPEDE study, which demonstrated that abiraterone achieved positive efficacy outcomes for both rPFS and OS in the target patient population, regardless of risk status (James et al 2017).  In addition, as noted above, classifying patients with prostate cancer for treatment based on risk status is not distinguished within treatment guidelines, and is not routinely done in the clinic. Only adenocarcinomas without small-cell histology are allowed; this is consistent with the LATITUDE study (Fizazi et al 2017), which was the primary basis for the approval of abiraterone in mHSPC. The presence of metastatic disease will be confirmed using standard imaging techniques that are widely used in the staging of prostate cancer in routine clinical practice, with RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 principles adopted for assessment of metastatic lesions. Only patients with ECOG performance status 0 or 1 are eligible, in line with guidelines recommending that abiraterone should be offered only to patients with ECOG status 0 or 1. The use of mild opioid analgesics for cancer-related pain, bisphosphonates and denosumab for management of bone-related metastases, LHRH analogues (ie, ADT) to maintain testosterone < 50 ng\/dL, conventional multivitamins and selenium, prednisone dose increases and eplerenone to manage refractory mineralocorticoid-related toxicities, transfusions and haematopoietic growth factors will all be permitted during the study.  However, where possible, these will be kept at a stable dose to allow accurate characterisation of the capivasertib treatment effect. Stratification Factors The randomisation scheme will be stratified based a combination of volume of disease and presence of visceral metastases, and also geographic location (as described in Section 4.1). Volume of disease as determined by the CHAARTED criteria is considered a key prognostic factor in prostate cancer.  High volume disease is defined as the presence of visceral metastases or \u2265 4 bone lesions with \u2265 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis.  Although abiraterone has been shown to provide benefit to patients with mHSPC in each risk status and volume subgroup, the overall prognosis as measured by median failure-free survival, PFS, and OS was markedly shorter in patients with high disease volume (Hoyle et al 2019).  This prognostic effect is further supported by analyses of other agents in mHSPC (Sweeney et al 2015, Stenzl et al 2019). Presence of visceral metastases is a known prognostic factor in prostate cancer and was incorporated into both the LATITUDE risk and CHAARTED disease volume criteria.  However, visceral tumour sites (eg, lung and liver metastases) were shown to be independently related to worse prognosis in a meta-analysis of 8802 men with prostate cancer (Halabi at al 2016).  The combination of volume of disease (high versus low) according to CHAARTED criteria and presence of visceral metastases results in a stratification factor with 3 levels (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease), as according to the definition, patients with low disease volume would not have visceral metastases.  For the purposes of this study, visceral metastases are defined by the list provided within the IWRS. The geographic split of Western Europe, Australia plus United States, Latin America plus Eastern Europe, and Asia was chosen to account for possible differences in PSA screening, and healthcare accessibility and quality in different regions that could affect both the primary treatment outcome and post study (eg, OS) endpoints. Study Endpoints The definition of rPFS (see Section 8.1.2.1) is considered to be consistent with EMA guidance in the prostate cancer-specific appendix to the Guideline on the Evaluation of Anticancer Medicinal Products in Man (EMA 2015) which recognises PFS as an acceptable primary endpoint.  PFS is also listed in the FDA's table of surrogate endpoints and has supported prior approvals in prostate cancer (FDA 2019).  Reducing the risk of radiographic progression is of clinical importance given the strong positive correlation reported for PFS and OS in patients with mCRPC.  Also, a recent study of enzalutamide in patients with mHSPC (ARCHES; Armstrong et al 2019) which was the basis of the recent FDA approval and positive opinion adopted by the CHMP for this indication, utilised rPFS as the primary endpoint.  The Phase III study supporting the FDA approval of apalutamide used rPFS as a dual primary endpoint (with OS) (Chi et al 2019). The median OS for the mHSPC patient population treated with ADT and abiraterone is over 5 years.  It is considered that an unfeasibly large and long study (more than 4000 patients and a study duration of over 11 years) would be required to obtain sufficient statistical power to detect OS differences in a reasonable timeframe.  However, the study population will be followed up after the primary analysis for rPFS for longer term endpoints, including OS. The key secondary efficacy endpoints for this study have been widely adopted in clinical studies in patients with prostate cancer and overall, are considered to represent the most clinically meaningful events for patients.  Prostate cancer typically metastasises to bone and is associated with risk of pathological fractures, spinal cord compression and severe pain with detrimental impact on quality of life.

Following written informed consent, all participants will undergo central PTEN status assessment using the IHC assay (see Section 6.1.2) and initial eligibility criteria review, as defined by the marked criteria (*) in Section 5.1 (inclusion criteria) and Section 5.2 (exclusion criteria), below. 5.1  Inclusion Criteria Participants are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria apply: Age 1  *Participant must be \u2265 18 years of age (\u2265 20 years of age in Japan), at the time of signing the informed consent. Type of Participant and Disease Characteristics *Histologically-confirmed de novo (ie, diagnosed within 3 months of randomisation) metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma.  Note: adenocarcinoma must be the primary histological pattern and patients with small-cell tumours are not eligible. *Consent to provide a FFPE tissue block (preferred) or slides.  Details on tissue requirements are specified in the Laboratory Manual.  Cytologic or FNA samples are not acceptable.  Tumour tissue from bone metastases is not acceptable. *A valid PTEN IHC result indicating PTEN deficiency (centralised testing). Metastatic disease documented prior to randomisation by clear evidence of \u2265 1 bone lesion (defined as 1 lesion with positive uptake on bone scan) and\/or \u2265 1 soft tissue lesion (measurable and\/or non-measurable) that can be accurately assessed at baseline and is suitable for repeated assessment with CT and\/or MRI.  Patients with metastatic disease identified by PSMA PET only, will not be eligible.  Local lymph node involvement is not considered metastatic disease. Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic form of prostate cancer based on the investigator's clinical evaluation. *Candidate for abiraterone and steroid therapy.  Previous treatment with abiraterone and\/or a steroid for de novo disease is allowed up to a maximum of 3 months prior to randomisation (prior treatment with chemotherapy or other NHAs is not allowed). Ongoing ADT with GnRH analogue (combination with first generation androgen receptor antagonists, eg, bicalutamide is allowed), or LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy.  Duration of ongoing ADT (regardless of method) is from 0 days to a maximum of 3 months prior to randomisation. ECOG\/WHO performance status 0 to 1 (see Appendix A) with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks. *Able and willing to swallow and retain oral medication. Participants must complete the 7-day BPI-SF and BFI questionnaires and the analgesic diary during screening (only after PTEN deficiency is confirmed), prior to randomisation.  Note: it is required to give participants at least 7 consecutive days to complete the assessments prior to randomisation.  If a minimum of 4 assessments is not completed during the 7-day period, participants must be re-screened, a new 7 days of questionnaire\/diary entries completed, and any screening tests which are consequently outside of the applicable 28 days prior to randomisation must also be repeated.  Sex *Participants will be male. Reproduction 13  Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm: Sterilisation (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). Participants should use barrier contraception (ie, condoms) from the time of screening until 16 weeks after discontinuation of study drug.  It is not known whether the pre-clinical changes seen in the male animal reproductive organs, after treatment with capivasertib, will be fully reversible or will permanently affect the ability to produce healthy sperm following treatment.  Therefore, if participants wish to father children, they should be advised to arrange for collection of sperm samples prior to the start of study treatment. Informed Consent *Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix B 3, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICF and in this CSP. Provision of signed and dated written Optional Genetic Research Information informed consent prior to collection of samples for optional genetic research that supports Genomic Initiative. 5.2  Exclusion Criteria Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply: Medical Conditions Radiotherapy with a wide field of radiation (eg, more than one-third of the skeleton) within 4 weeks before the start of study treatment (capivasertib\/placebo). Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access, transurethral resection of prostate, bilateral orchiectomy, or internal stents) within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment.

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) if no demonstrable liver metastases or > 5x ULN in the presence of liver metastases.  Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is not exclusionary if due to the presence of bone metastases and liver function is otherwise considered adequate in the investigator's judgement. Total bilirubin > 1.5x ULN (participants with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome may be included in the study with a higher value) Creatinine > 1.5x ULN concurrent with creatinine clearance < 50 mL\/min (measured or calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation); confirmation of creatinine clearance is only required when creatinine is > 1.5x ULN. *As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including active bleeding diatheses, or known active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV.  Screening for chronic conditions is not required. Participants who are unevaluable for both bone and soft tissue progression as defined by meeting both of the following criteria: A bone scan referred to as a superscan showing an intense symmetric activity in the bones and no or limited technetium excretion by the kidneys, and No soft tissue lesion (measurable or non-measurable) that can be assessed by RECIST criteria. *Refractory nausea and vomiting, malabsorption syndrome, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to swallow the formulated product or previous significant bowel resection, or other condition that would preclude adequate absorption of capivasertib. *Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding that, in the investigator's opinion, gives reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that contra-indicates the use of an investigational drug, may affect the interpretation of the results, render the patient at high risk from treatment complications or interferes with obtaining informed consent. *Evidence of dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prohibit understanding or rendering of informed consent. *Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant or solid organ transplant. *Known additional malignancy that has had progression or has required active treatment in the last 3 years.

The clinical relevance of this is unknown, but until further information is available a conservative approach has been taken to recommend that participants fast from at least 2 hours before dosing to at least 1 hour after dosing, where possible.  Water can be allowed as desired. In addition, participants should avoid herbal supplements (eg, St John's wort) and ingestion of large amounts of foods and beverages known to potently modulate CYP3A4 enzyme activity, during study treatment.  For example, no more than half a grapefruit, a small glass of grapefruit juice or 2 teaspoons of Seville orange marmalade should be consumed daily.  Please refer to Appendix C for further guidance. Participants will be required to fast from at least 2 hours before until at least 1 hour after each dose of abiraterone, due to an effect of food on absorption.  Water can be allowed as desired. 5.3.2  Caffeine, Alcohol, and Tobacco No interactions with caffeine, alcohol or tobacco have been identified. 5.3.3  Contraception Participants must use a condom during treatment and for 16 weeks after the last dose of capivasertib when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential.  Female partners of male participants should also use a highly effective form of contraception (as described in Appendix D) if they are of childbearing potential.  Participants should not donate sperm throughout the period of taking capivasertib and for 3 months following the last dose of capivasertib. 5.3.4  Other Restrictions Participants who are blood donors should not donate blood during the study and for 3 months following their last dose of study treatment.  For blood donation after study participation, refer to WHO guidelines (WHO 2012). 5.4  Screen Failures Screen failures are defined as patients who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently randomised.  A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities.  Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any SAE.  If a patient is ineligible and not randomised, the IWRS should be contacted to terminate the participant in the system (screen failed). Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may be rescreened once (per screening part), upon the Study Physician's approval and agreement.  However, rescreening should be documented so that its effect on study results, if any, can be assessed.  These participants should have the reason for study withdrawal, including failed inclusion\/exclusion criteria, recorded in the eCRF.  Rescreened participants should be assigned the same participant number as for the initial screening."

Where possible, all doses of capivasertib\/placebo should be taken at approximately the same time each day, 12 hours apart in a fasted state (water to drink only) from at least 2 hours prior to the dose to at least 1 hour post-dose.  Additional fasting restrictions apply on days where fasting glucose is to be tested (Section 8.2.4.1).  If vomiting occurs, a replacement dose should not be taken, and the participant should take their allotted dose at the next scheduled time. Should a participant miss a scheduled dose, the participant will be allowed to take the dose up to a maximum of 2 hours after the scheduled dose time, with a fasting state being maintained.  If greater than 2 hours after the scheduled dose time, the missed dose should not be taken, and the participant should take their allotted dose at the next scheduled time.  If a participant needs to take the dose earlier, the participant can take the dose up to 2 hours earlier than the scheduled dose time.  The participant should make every reasonable effort to take the capivasertib\/placebo tablet(s) on time. Any regular medication required by the participant can be taken at the same time as capivasertib\/placebo in a fasted state (as described above), provided that this does not contravene the dosing instructions in the prescribing information for that medication. Abiraterone should be taken under fasting conditions (only water to drink) from at least 2 hours prior to dosing to at least 1 hour post-dose.  The tablets should be swallowed whole with water and not crushed or chewed. 6.1.2  Medical Devices Documented PTEN deficiency of tumour tissue is required for selection of participants onto the study.  All participants must provide FFPE tumour tissue (block or slides) from primary or metastatic sites (excluding bone metastases or FNA samples) for IHC-based determination of PTEN deficiency.  Ventana Medical Systems (Tucson, USA) will provide the Investigational Use Only (IUO) assay for centralised PTEN IHC testing.  This assay is being developed for approval as a companion diagnostic for capivasertib. 6.2  Preparation\/Handling\/Storage\/Accountability of Interventions The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study intervention received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study intervention. Only participants randomised in the study may receive study intervention and only authorised site staff may supply or administer study intervention.  All study intervention must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labelled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorised site staff. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). Any study drug remaining at the end of the study must be destroyed or returned according to the sites local standard operating procedures following authorisation by the sponsor. 6.3  Measures to Minimise Bias: Randomisation and Blinding Eligible participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio (capivasertib + abiraterone: placebo + abiraterone) by a permuted block randomisation approach stratified on the following factors: Combination of volume of disease according to CHAARTED criteria and presence of visceral metastases (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease) Geographic location (North America, Western Europe, and Australia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and Asia). Capivasertib and placebo tablets will be identical and presented in the same packaging to ensure blinding of the capivasertib.  Capivasertib and placebo will be labelled using a unique kit identification (kit ID) number, which is linked to the randomisation scheme. All participants will be centrally assigned to randomised study treatment using an IWRS.  Before the study is initiated, the log-in information and directions for the IWRS will be provided to each study site. Abiraterone will be allocated to be dispensed to each participant using the IWRS system (if centrally sourced) or via the local pharmacy (if locally sourced) at each participant dispensing visit.  Routines for this will be described in the IWRS user manual that will be provided to each centre. Each patient will obtain a unique randomisation number via the IWRS. The actual treatment given to individual participants will be determined by a randomisation scheme that will be loaded into the IWRS database.  The randomisation scheme will be produced by a computer software program called AZRand (AZ Global Randomisation system) that incorporates a standard procedure for generating random numbers. A blocked randomisation will be generated, and all centres will use the same list in order to minimise any imbalance in the number of participants assigned to each treatment group. Eligibility will be established before treatment randomisation.  It is recommended that participants commence study treatment as soon as possible after randomisation and ideally on the same day of randomisation. If a participant withdraws from the study, then his enrolment\/randomisation code cannot be reused.  Withdrawn participants will not be replaced. The IWRS will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions.  In case of an emergency, in which the knowledge of the specific blinded study treatment will affect the immediate management of the participant's condition (eg, antidote available), the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participants' intervention assignment is warranted.  Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination.  If a participant's intervention assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind.  The investigator must document and report the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing to AstraZeneca staff the treatment that was given to the participant. AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an IMP and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities.  Randomisation codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual participant have been made and documented. 6.4  Study Intervention Compliance Data regarding capivasertib\/placebo dosing will be collected during the scheduled site visits and entered into the eCRF along with reasons for missed dose(s) if applicable. In addition, participants will be required to return all bottles of study medication at the start of the next cycle.  The number of tablets remaining will be counted by the research nurse\/ pharmacist\/investigator, documented in the eCRF and returned to pharmacy.  Site personnel are responsible for managing the IMP from receipt by the study site until the destruction or return of all unused IMP. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the participant has returned all unused IMP. 6.5  Concomitant Therapy Any medication or vaccine, including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and\/or herbal supplements, that the participant is receiving at the time of enrolment or receives during the study must be recorded along with: Reason for use Dates of administration including start and end dates Dosage information including dose and frequency This includes details relating to the ADT and prednisone\/prednisolone administered as standard background treatment with the abiraterone. Guidance regarding potential interactions of capivasertib with concomitant medications is provided in Appendix C. 6.5.1  Recommended Concomitant Therapy The following therapies are recommended during study participation, as applicable: Corticosteroids: In the treatment of patients with mHSPC, abiraterone is indicated for use with corticosteroid in the form of 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone daily in line with the locally approved abiraterone package insert.  An increased dose of the corticosteroid may be indicated during and after a stressful situation.  Participants will receive the treating investigator's choice of commercially available prednisone or prednisolone. Androgen deprivation therapy: Abiraterone is indicated for use in combination with ADT; therefore, participants must be receiving the treating investigator's choice of commercially available LHRH analogues or have received surgical castration. Anti-diarrhoeal therapy for symptomatic treatment of diarrhoea, as indicated in the toxicity management guideline (see Section 8.3.12.3). Antidiabetic therapy for management of hyperglycaemia (see Section 8.3.12.3). Concomitant medication may be given as medically indicated.  Details (including doses, frequency, route, and start and stop dates) of the concomitant medication given must be recorded in the participant's medical records and in the eCRF. 6.5.2  Restricted Concomitant Therapy The following concomitant therapies are restricted during study treatment: Other anticancer agents, other investigational agents and radiotherapy, although radiation for palliation at focal sites is permitted (as long as the radiation field covers less than 30% of the marrow and does not include whole pelvis or spine; disease progression in the bones has to be excluded by appropriate imaging investigations). Drugs or herbal supplements that are known to be potent inhibitors\/inducers of CYP3A4, as they may increase\/decrease the exposure and thus, affect the toxicity\/efficacy of capivasertib. Drugs known to be sensitive to inhibition of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and\/or CYP2D6 metabolism and\/or MATE1 or OCT2 transport, and which have a narrow therapeutic window; see Appendix C for details.  If co-administration is necessary, then additional monitoring for signs of toxicity related to increased exposure to the substrates is required. The concomitant administration of drugs known to prolong the QT interval is restricted unless considered essential due to participant management, in which case, participants should be closely monitored.  Information regarding drugs known to prolong the QT interval can be found at URL: https:\/\/crediblemeds.org. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers and CYP2D6 substrates with abiraterone; for more details on restrictions and cautions required when administering concomitant medications with abiraterone, please refer to abiraterone local prescribing information. Patients are not eligible to enter the study if they have received any of the medications specified in the exclusion criteria or are unable to observe the cautions and restrictions for restricted therapies (for details please compare Section 5.2 and Appendix C). 6.5.3  Other Concomitant Treatment Supportive care, and other medication, other than that described in Section 6.5.2, considered necessary for the participant's safety and well-being, may be given at the discretion of the investigator and recorded in the appropriate sections of the eCRF. 6.6  Dose Modification 6.6.1  Dose Modification for Capivasertib Dose reductions or holds are allowed as clinically indicated by the treating physician and in line with Table 5.  For each participant, a maximum of 2 dose reductions will be allowed for capivasertib\/placebo.  Dose re-escalations are not allowed for either capivasertib\/placebo. Dose reductions for capivasertib\/placebo should be carried out as described in Table 5.  The dose of capivasertib\/placebo can be reduced twice (initially, reduction to dose reduction level 1; subsequently, in case of occurrence of further \u2265 grade 3 toxicity, further reduction to dose reduction level 2).  For guidance on dose reductions for management of capivasertib related AEs, refer to Section 8.3.12. Table 5  Dose Levels for Capivasertib\/Placebo Study Treatment  Study Treatment Starting Dose  Starting Dose Dose Reduction Levels  Dose Reduction Levels Capivasertib\/placebo  Capivasertib\/placebo 400 mg twice daily  400 mg twice daily Reduction level 1: 320 mg twice daily  Reduction level 1: 320 mg twice daily Reduction level 2: 200 mg twice daily  Reduction level 2: 200 mg twice daily Study Treatment Starting Dose Dose Reduction Levels Capivasertib\/placebo 400 mg twice daily Reduction level 1: 320 mg twice daily Reduction level 2: 200 mg twice daily In the event of an AE which the investigator considers to be related to the administration of study treatment, supportive therapy should be given at the discretion of the investigator.  In addition, the investigator may decide that dosing of study treatment should be temporarily interrupted, a subsequent treatment cycle delayed, or study treatment permanently discontinued as per the guidelines outlined in Section 7.1. Substantial acute toxicities should be managed as medically indicated and with temporary suspension of study drug, as appropriate. A maximum break of 4 consecutive weeks is allowed within each treatment cycle or between 2 consecutive cycles.  Following a treatment break the participant can resume treatment at the Day in the cycle that they stopped.  If the treatment break is longer than the maximum of 4 consecutive weeks, the investigator will need permission from the sponsor Study Physician to allow the participant to restart study treatment. 6.6.2  Dose Modification for Abiraterone In case dose reductions are necessary for abiraterone, the investigator should refer to abiraterone local prescribing information for further details.  These dose reductions should be documented in the eCRF. 6.7  Intervention after the End of the Study After the clinical study database closes, participants who continue to derive clinical benefit from study treatments in the opinion of the investigator may continue to receive study treatment until progression.  These treatments will continue to be provided by AstraZeneca until the availability of either a local commercial supplier and reimbursement programme or an early access programme; at which point a change in supply will be requested.  Treatment of participants beyond progression is not allowed. Please refer to Section 4.4 for End of Study definition. 7  DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION\/WITHDRAWAL"

The investigator must document and report the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing to AstraZeneca staff the treatment that was given to the participant. AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an IMP and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities.  Randomisation codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual participant have been made and documented."

Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria.  The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the participant's routine clinical management (eg, blood count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilised for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA. The investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRFs.  A Web-based Data Capture system will be used for data collection and query handling. The investigator must ensure the accuracy and completeness for eCRFs, which includes legibility and timeliness of the data recorded and of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement.  The investigator will sign the completed eCRFs.  A copy of the completed eCRFs will be archived at the study site. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples. 8.1  Efficacy Assessments 8.1.1  Tumour Assessments Tumour assessments will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and a bone scan for whole body.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before randomisation, and ideally, should be performed as close as possible to randomisation.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) relative to the date of randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), regardless of discontinuation of study treatment (eg, discontinuation due to toxicity or clinical progression) or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy. The assessments by different imaging modalities (eg, CT and bone scintigraphy) can be done on different days but should all be performed within the assessment schedule.  It is important to follow the imaging assessment schedule as closely as possible; however, tumour assessment can be performed at any time when disease progression is clinically suspected.  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged.  If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at the participant's scheduled visits. Participants who discontinue study treatment prior to progression should continue to be scanned until progression.  The same imaging modality and the same assessment (eg, the same contrast protocol for CT scans) should be performed at baseline and at all follow-up time points. Radiological examinations performed during the study should be retained at site as source data. 8.1.2  Evaluation of Disease Progression 8.1.2.1  Radiographic PFS Radiographic PFS is defined as the time from randomisation to: 1) radiographic progression, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), or 2) death due to any cause regardless of whether the participant withdraws from randomised treatment or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression. Radiographic PFS will be measured by investigator assessment, and a sensitivity analysis of PFS assessed by BICR will also be conducted (see Section 8.1.2.4). The definitions of measurable, non-measurable, target and non-target lesions for assessment of soft tissue using RECIST 1.1 criteria, methods of assessment, and the objective tumour response criteria are provided in Appendix E 2.  The PCWG3 guidelines are provided in Appendix E 3. Participants who have not progressed, as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) or PCWG3 criteria (bone), or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 assessment.  However, if the participant progresses or dies immediately after 2 or more consecutive missed visits, the participant will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 bone assessment prior to the 2 missed visits. 8.1.2.2  Evaluation of Soft Tissue Lesions The criteria for objective tumour response on soft tissue lesions will be based on RECIST 1.1: CR (complete response), PR (partial response), SD (stable disease), PD (progressive disease), NE (not evaluable), and NED (no evidence of disease). For participants with measurable lesion at baseline, target lesion progression will be calculated in reference to the smallest tumour burden on study (ie, the smallest sum of diameters previously recorded on study).  In the absence of progression, target lesion response will be calculated using as reference the baseline tumour measurements obtained before starting treatment.  For these participants, the objective tumour response assessment options are CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE. For participants with non-measurable soft tissue lesions only at baseline, the objective tumour response assessment options are CR, PD, Non CR\/Non PD, and NE. For participants with bone lesions only and no soft tissue disease at baseline, the objective tumour response assessment options will be NED, PD (if a new soft tissue lesion appears), or NE (if the scan is not performed). If the investigator is in doubt as to whether disease progression has occurred, particularly with regard to non-target lesions or the appearance of a new lesion, it is advisable to continue treatment and reassess the tumour burden at the next scheduled assessment or sooner if clinically indicated.  If repeat scans confirm progression, then the date of the initial scan should be declared as the date of progression.  New bone lesions should not be counted in the RECIST assessment. To achieve \u2018unequivocal progression' on the basis of non-target lesions, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest \u2018increase' in the size of 1 or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. 8.1.2.3  Evaluation of Bone Lesions Progression on a bone scan is identified using PCWG3 criteria, by having 2 or more new metastatic bone lesions. For participants without progression at the first visit after baseline, the scan from this first visit after baseline now serves as new reference for all subsequent scans, ie, assuming all visits are acquired according to schedule, all bone scans after Week 16 are compared to the Week 16 scan. The requirements for determination of radiographic progression by either bone scan (bone progression) or CT\/MRI (soft tissue progression) are summarised in Table 6. Table 6  Requirements for Documentation of Radiographic Progression Visit Date  Visit Date   None Criteria for Bone Progression  Criteria for Bone Progression Criteria for Soft Tissue Progression  Criteria for Soft Tissue Progression First tumour assessment after baseline  First tumour assessment after baseline \u2022  \u2022 \u2022  \u2022 2 or more new lesions compared to baseline bone scan, and  2 or more new lesions compared to baseline bone scan, and Confirmed by an additional 2 or more new lesions compared to the first post-baseline bone scan at least  Confirmed by an additional 2 or more new lesions compared to the first post-baseline bone scan at least 6 weeks later  6 weeks later Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1  Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1 No confirmation required  No confirmation required From the second tumour assessment after baseline  From the second tumour assessment after baseline \u2022  \u2022 \u2022  \u2022 2 or more new lesions compared to the first bone scan after baseline No confirmation required  2 or more new lesions compared to the first bone scan after baseline No confirmation required Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1  Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1 No confirmation required  No confirmation required Visit Date None Criteria for Bone Progression Criteria for Soft Tissue Progression First tumour assessment after baseline \u2022 \u2022 2 or more new lesions compared to baseline bone scan, and Confirmed by an additional 2 or more new lesions compared to the first post-baseline bone scan at least 6 weeks later Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1 No confirmation required From the second tumour assessment after baseline \u2022 \u2022 2 or more new lesions compared to the first bone scan after baseline No confirmation required Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1 No confirmation required CT Computed tomography; MRI Magnetic resonance imaging; RECIST Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. 8.1.2.4  Central Reading of Scans A BICR of the scans will be conducted and the results used in a sensitivity analysis of rPFS. Images, including unscheduled visit scans, will be collected on an ongoing basis and sent to an AstraZeneca-appointed imaging Contract Research Organisation (iCRO) for QC, storage, and for BICR.  Digital copies of all original scans should be stored at the investigator site as source documents.  Electronic image transfer from the sites to the iCRO is strongly encouraged.  A BICR of images will be performed at the discretion of AstraZeneca.  Results of these independent reviews will not be communicated to investigators, and results of investigator tumour assessments will not be shared with the central reviewers.  The management of participants will be based solely upon the results of the RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and PCWG3 (bone) assessment conducted by the investigator. All treatment decisions will be based on site assessment of scans.  After the primary rPFS analysis, central review of scans will no longer be required, and investigators will be advised when to stop sending copies of the scans to the CRO conducting the central review. 8.1.2.5  PFS2 PFS2 is defined as the time from randomisation until progression on next-line treatment (ie, the line of treatment following the first progression in the study), as clinical progression, PSA progression, or radiographic progression determined by RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone) as assessed by the investigator, or death due to any cause.  Censoring details will be defined in the SAP. A participant will enter the PFS2 follow-up period once that participant has discontinued study treatment due to progressive disease by RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue lesions and\/or PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions. The participant's status at first progression will be used as the reference for assessment of PFS2. RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 assessments will not be collected for assessment of PFS2. The date of PFS2 assessment and the investigator's opinion of progression status (progressed or non-progressed) at each assessment will be recorded in the eCRF.  Determination of progressive disease for PFS2 will be by institutional call. 8.1.3  Overall Survival Overall survival is the length of time from randomisation until the date of death due to any cause.  In the survival follow-up period, all subsequent cancer therapies and vital status will be documented at least every 12 weeks until death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first. Any participant not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the participant was known to be alive. Survival information may be obtained via telephone contact with the participant, participant's family, by contact with the participant's current physician, or local death registries as described in Section 7.3. Survival calls will be made in the week following the date of DCO for each of the rPFS or OS analyses.  If participants are confirmed to be alive or if the death date is after the DCO date, these participants will be censored at the date of DCO. 8.1.4  Time to PSA Progression Time to PSA progression is defined as the time from randomisation to PSA progression, as determined by PCWG3 criteria: PSA progression is the date that an increase of 25% or more and absolute increase of 2 ng\/mL or more from the nadir are documented, which is confirmed by a second value obtained 3 or more weeks later.  Censoring details for this endpoint will be defined in the SAP. Blood samples for PSA measurements will be collected and evaluated by the local testing laboratory at timelines as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  These assessments should continue until disease progression, regardless of discontinuation of study treatment. 8.1.5  Time to First Subsequent Therapy Time to First Subsequent Therapy (TFST) is defined as time from randomisation to the earlier of start date of the first subsequent anticancer therapy after discontinuation of randomised treatment, or death due to any cause. All anticancer treatments (including, but not limited to, chemotherapy and targeted agents), and the investigator's opinion of response to these treatments plus the date of progression, following discontinuation of study treatment, must be recorded.  Subsequent systemic anticancer therapies (excluding radiotherapy) will be reviewed prior to data unblinding to assess which represent clinically important treatments intended to control prostate cancer.  Any participant not known to have died at the time of the analysis and not known to have had a further anticancer therapy will be censored at the last known time to have not received subsequent therapy, ie, the last follow-up visit where this was confirmed. 8.1.6  SSE-FS Symptomatic skeletal event-free survival (SSE-FS) is defined as the time from randomisation until any of the following (or death due to any cause): Use of radiation therapy to prevent or relieve skeletal symptoms. Occurrence of new symptomatic pathological bone fractures (vertebral or non-vertebral).  Radiologic documentation is required.  A pathological fracture, as determined by investigator, is defined as associated with low or no trauma and deemed to have occurred at a site of bone metastasis. Occurrence of spinal cord compression.  Radiologic documentation is required. Orthopaedic surgical intervention for bone metastasis. Participants who have not experienced any of the above conditions will be censored at the time of the last SSE assessment. Assessments for symptomatic skeletal events will be performed at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 1.3), and should continue beyond disease progression, regardless of discontinuation of study treatment. 8.1.7  Time to Castration Resistance Time to castration resistance (TTCR) is defined as the time from randomisation to the first castration-resistant event (radiographic disease progression, PSA progression, or SSE), whichever occurs first, at castrate levels of testosterone (below 50 ng\/dL).  Censoring details will be defined in the SAP. The timepoints of assessments for radiographic progression and SSEs, and collection of samples for determination of PSA and serum testosterone levels are indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3). 8.1.8  Patient-reported Outcomes A clinical outcome assessment (COA) is an assessment of a clinical outcome reported by a clinician, a patient, or a non-clinician observer, or through a performance-based assessment (FDA-NIH BEST Resource).  A COA may be used in clinical studies to provide either direct or indirect evidence of treatment benefit.  It is important to examine the impact of therapy on disease-related symptoms, physical function, and other HRQoL of the patient to aid understanding of how clinical benefit relates to patient well-being and for consideration in making risk-benefit evaluations.  PRO is one type of clinical outcome assessment and is a general term referring to all outcomes and symptoms that are directly reported by the patient.  Moreover, PROs assist in the documentation of symptoms and specifically what symptoms and impacts are most important to patients and how these relate to clinical outcomes.  PROs have become important in evaluating effectiveness of study treatments in clinical studies and will aid in understanding of the benefit\/risk evaluation (Kluetz et al 2018).  The following PROs will be administered in this study: BPI-SF, BFI, FACT-P, PGIS, EQ-5D-5L, and selected questions from the PRO-CTCAE items library.  Samples of the PRO questionnaires are provided in Appendix F.  PROs will be administered according to the SoA (Section 1.3).  PROs will be provided in the native language(s) of the country in which they will be administered, except for PRO-CTCAE, which will only be administered in the languages where a linguistically validated version is available. 8.1.8.1  BPI-SF The BPI-SF (Appendix F 1) is a validated, 15-item domain-specific instrument designed to assess the severity of pain and the impact\/interference of pain on daily functions (Cleeland and Ryan 1994).  The BPI-SF will be scored according to the user guide (Cleeland 2009).  All BPI-SF pain items including \u2018worst pain' is scored on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS) with 0 = No Pain and 10 = Worst Pain Imaginable.  This instrument consists of 2 domains: pain severity and pain interference.  The pain severity domain consists of 4 items (Item 3, Item 4, Item 5, and Item 6) which assess pain at its \u2018worst,' \u2018least,' \u2018average,' and \u2018now' (current pain) respectively on the 11-point NRS.  These 4 items may be averaged as a composite pain severity score or they may be interpreted individually (Dworkin et al 2005, Dworkin et al 2008, FDA 2009, Turk et al 2006).  In this study, the \u2018worst pain' (Item 3) will be used as a single item in assessing pain progression.  A composite pain severity score from all the 4 items will also be evaluated.  A 2- or more point change in the \u2018worst pain' item is considered clinically meaningful. The pain interference domain score is a mean of 7 items: general activity (Item 9A), mood (Item 9B), walking ability (Item 9C), normal work (Item 9D), relations with other people (Item 9E), sleep (Item 9F), and enjoyment of life (Item 9G), each scored on an 11-point NRS from 0 (Does not interfere) to 10 (Completely interferes).  Based on the BPI-SF scoring manual, the following items are not used in scoring pain severity or pain interference domains: Items 1, 2, 7, and 8.  Item 7 (a free text field) describing pain medication use is captured separately in more detail using the analgesic log. The BPI-SF analgesic log (captured on ePRO device) will be completed by the participant as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Further details on the analgesic log and scoring are provided in Sections 8.1.8.8 and 8.1.8.9, respectively. Time to pain progression is a key secondary endpoint of this study (see Section 8.1.8.2).  In addition, change from baseline in pain severity and pain interference domain scores may be derived. 8.1.8.2  Time to Pain Progression The key secondary endpoint of TTPP is defined as the time from randomisation to the time point at which clinically meaningful pain progression is observed, based on a 2-point increase from baseline in the BPI-SF Item 3 \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' score and\/or initiation of\/increase in opiate analgesic use.  A minimum of 4 days of data is required.  The criteria for pain progression depend on whether a participant is asymptomatic or symptomatic at baseline: Asymptomatic participants at baseline (average BPI-SF Item 3 score of 0 and not taking opioids) Increase of 2 or more points in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' (BPI-SF Item 3) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks) OR Initiation of opioid use for pain Symptomatic participants at baseline (average BPI-SF Item 3 score > 0 and\/or currently taking opioids) Increase of 2 or more points in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' (BPI-SF Item 3) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks) and an average worst pain score \u2265 4, and no decrease in average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or more points decrease in AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher OR Increase in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or more points increase (or at least 2 points increase if the starting value is 0) in the AQA score from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks). Participants satisfying one or more of the criteria above will be considered to have pain progression.  Participants who do not satisfy any of the criteria above will be censored at the time of the last known assessment that showed an absence of pain progression. Censoring A number of situations will lead to a participant's time to pain progression being censored; these are as follows: If a participant meets the criteria for pain progression after 2 or more missed visits (visits which showed < 4 days of BPI-SF worst pain [Item 3] assessments and the average AQA score does not meet the progression criteria), then the participant will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used). Participants who have not met the criteria for pain progression at the time of analysis: The censoring date will be the date of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used). Participants with no evaluable baseline or post-baseline data will be censored at Day 1. For participants who receive subsequent anticancer therapy: The censoring date will be the date of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment prior to the start date of subsequent anticancer therapy (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used) Participants with no evaluable baseline or post-baseline data will be censored at Day 1. 8.1.8.3  Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) The BFI (Appendix F 2) is a self-administered instrument developed to assess the severity of fatigue and the impact of fatigue on functioning (Mendoza et al 1999).  It includes 9 items which measure fatigue severity (3 items) and fatigue interference (6 items).  The first 3 items (Item 1, Item 2, and Item 3) ask participants about their: level of fatigue right now, usual level of fatigue within the past 24 hours, and fatigue at its worst level within the past 24 hours on an 11-point NRS of 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine).  The 6 fatigue interference items (Item 4A, Item 4B, Item 4C, Item 4D, Item 4E, and Item 4F, respectively) evaluate participants on the extent to which fatigue interfered with their daily activities (ie, general activity, mood, walking, work, relationships, and enjoyment of life) on an 11-point NRS of 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).  While not developed specifically for prostate cancer or mHSPC, its reliability and clinical and concurrent validity have been demonstrated in cancer more generally (Mendoza et al 1999, Whitehead 2009).  It has also been used to measure fatigue in one mHSPC study (LATITUDE, Fizazi et al 2019) and one mCRPC study (COU-AA-301, Sternberg et al 2013), respectively.  The items\/scales used to measure fatigue in LATITUDE are not specified.  In COU-AA-301, fatigue was measured via \u2018fatigue intensity', defined as the score of the worst fatigue item (Item 3), and \u2018fatigue interference', defined as the average score of all the interference items (Items 4A - 4F).  A clinically important difference in \u2018fatigue intensity' was defined in this study as a change in \u2265 2 points from baseline, while a change in \u2265 1.25 points from baseline for \u2018fatigue interference' was considered clinically meaningful (Sternberg et al 2013).  These clinically important thresholds will be used in the current study. In this study, the \u2018worst fatigue' (Item 3) will be used as a single item in assessing deterioration in \u2018fatigue intensity'.  Also, a composite or mean score of 3 items (Items 1-3) will be evaluated as \u2018fatigue severity'.  Finally, a \u2018fatigue interference' domain score will be based on a mean of the 6 interference items (Items 4A-4F). The following may be derived as secondary endpoints: Time to deterioration in fatigue intensity (defined as a change \u2265 2 points from baseline in worst fatigue item [Item 3] score). Time to deterioration in fatigue interference (defined as a change \u2265 1.25 points from baseline in fatigue interference domain score). Change from baseline in fatigue severity and fatigue interference domain scores. 8.1.8.4  FACT-P The FACT-P (Appendix F 3) is a disease-specific 39-item questionnaire included for the purpose of assessing HRQoL and prostate cancer-specific symptoms.  It is a well-established measure of HRQoL\/health status commonly used in prostate cancer studies.  The FACT-P was developed specifically for patients with advanced prostate cancer and has been found to be reliable and valid in this population (Esper et al 1997).  The FACT-P consists of 5 subscales: Physical Well-Being (PWB; 7 items), Functional Well-Being (FWB; 7 items), Emotional Well-Being (EWB; 6 items), Social Well-Being (SWB; 7 items), and Additional Concerns or Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS) specific to prostate cancer (12 items).  All FACT-P questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4 (0 being not at all and 4 being very much).  Negatively stated items are reversed by subtracting the response from 4.  For all subscales, symptoms index, and individual item scores, the higher the score, the better the HRQoL\/symptom.  In addition to the Total and Subscale scores, the FACT-P also supports the calculation of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) total score (sum of PWB, SWB, EWB, and FWB scores), a Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score (the sum of the PWB, FWB, and PCS scores), and the FACT Advanced Prostate Symptom Index-6 (FAPSI-6), a symptom score made up of 6 items from within the FACT-P (3 pain items, 1 fatigue item, 1 weight loss item, and 1 condition getting worse item). The following may be derived as other secondary endpoints: Time to deterioration in FACT-P scores (FACT-P total score, FACT-G total score, TOI, functional well-being, physical well-being, prostate cancer subscale, and FAPSI-6, respectively). Change from baseline in FACT-P scores (FACT-P total score, FACT-G total score, TOI, functional well-being, physical well-being, prostate cancer subscale, and FAPSI-6, respectively). 8.1.8.5  PRO-CTCAE The PRO-CTCAE (Appendix F 5) will only be administered where a linguistically validated version exists for a country. PRO-CTCAE was developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and is included to address tolerability from the patients' perspective.  PRO-CTCAE is an item library of symptoms experienced by patients while undergoing treatment of their cancer.  It was developed in recognition that collecting treatment-related symptom data directly from patients using PRO tools can improve the accuracy and efficiency of symptomatic AE data collection.  This was based on findings from multiple studies demonstrating that physicians and nurses underestimate symptom onset, frequency, and severity in comparison with patient ratings (Basch et al 2009, Litwin et al 1998, Sprangers and Aaronson 1992).  To date, 78 symptoms of the CTCAE have been identified to be amenable to patient reporting.  These symptoms have been converted to patient terms (eg, CTCAE term \u2018myalgia' converted to \u2018aching muscles').  The items included in the PRO-CTCAE have undergone extensive qualitative review among experts and patients.  Using cognitive testing methods, these items and the additional questions for some of the symptoms have been extensively evaluated by cancer patients, so that symptoms of interest are clear, comprehendible, and measurable.  Not all items are administered in any one clinical study.  The intention is to only ask participants to complete those items considered relevant for the study, site of cancer, and cancer treatment.  Participants on all study arms will complete the same selection of symptom items for the PRO-CTCAE.  Several decision rules were applied to the selection to achieve an unbiased selection and reasonable patient completion time.  Safety data for capivasertib, abiraterone acetate, and hormonal treatments (administered in both arms of the study) informed the symptom selection.  Safety and AE data for capivasertib was accessed via the most recent IB, while the US Package Inserts were used to assess the abiraterone and ADT.  Symptomatic AEs from the PRO-CTCAE items library that are considered relevant based on the reported safety and AEs for capivasertib, abiraterone, and hormonal treatments were selected for this study (see Appendix F 5). The Free Text item in the PRO-CTCAE instrument is not included in this study, as the utility of this information and the analysis method have not been established.  The full list of items is available in Appendix F 5. 8.1.8.6  PGIS The impact of treatment on the overall severity of cancer symptoms over the past week will be assessed using the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) single-item questionnaire (Appendix F 4).  PGIS is useful for determining the responder threshold of other PRO measures. 8.1.8.7  EQ-5D-5L The EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal (EuroQol Group 1990).  Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in population health surveys.  The questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions as follows: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain\/discomfort, and anxiety\/depression.  Each dimension has 5 response options (\u2018no problems', \u2018slight problems', \u2018moderate problems', \u2018severe problems', and \u2018extreme problems') that reflect increasing levels of difficulty (EuroQol Group 2013). Previous versions of EQ-5D had only 3 levels of difficulty, EQ-5D-3L.  Since 2009, the EuroQol Group developed a more sensitive version of the EQ-5D (the EQ-5D-5L) that expands the range of responses to each dimension from 3 to 5 levels of increasing severity (Herdman et al 2011).  Preliminary studies indicate that the 5L version improves upon the properties of the 3L measure in terms of reduced ceiling effect, increased reliability, and an improved ability to differentiate between different levels of health (Janssen et al 2008a, Janssen et al 2008b, Pickard et al 2007).  A sample of the EQ-5D-5L is provided in Appendix F 6. The participant will be asked to indicate their current health state by selecting the most appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensions.  The questionnaire also includes a visual analog scale, where the participant will be asked to rate current health status on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst imaginable health state. 8.1.8.8  Analgesic Log The analgesic log will be implemented using the ERT Medication Module\u2122, a component of the ERT eCOA System that serves for accurately tracking subject consumption of concomitant and\/or rescue medications.  The Medication Module allows medication data capture via the ERT eCOA Universal App, followed by the review and management of that data by sites and sponsors.  The Medication Module provides a consistent, easier-to-use and more efficient tool compared with paper-based reporting.  Using the module, participants will record all analgesic medication dosages and dosage times to track pain medications use.  The Medication Module includes the following components: Global Master Medication List: This list will be developed collaboratively by ERT and AstraZeneca and will contain all approved analgesic drug names including generic names and formulations.  The list will be updated over the course of the study via an approval workflow process, when necessary. eCOA Universal App Medication Diary: The medication diary will allow participants to log analgesic medication intake during scheduled assessments.  Study sites will check and update the medication diary for participants as needed throughout the study. Medication Report: This may be used to remotely update the tailored list of medications available on a participant's eCOA Universal App. The analgesic log is study specific (not generic) and screenshots will be available and submitted along with the CSP to IRB\/IECs. Although information on all analgesics used by participants in pain control will be collected using the analgesic log, only changes in opiate are considered in pain progression evaluation in line with FDA recommendation.  Opiates consumed by participants will be converted into oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) as defined in Chung et al 2014.  The analgesic quantification algorithm (AQA) developed by Chung et al 2014 will be used to quantify and score analgesic use in the study.  The AQA is an 8-point scale that assigns a score as follows: 0 = No analgesic 1 = Non-opioid analgesics 2 = Weak opioids (eg, codeine, tramadol) 3 = Strong opioids \u2264 75 mg OME per day 4 = Strong opioids > 75 to 150 mg OME per day 5 = Strong opioids > 150 to 300 mg OME per day 6 = Strong opioids > 300 to 600 mg OME per day 7 = Strong opioids > 600 mg OME per day 8.1.8.9  Analgesic Use Scoring Opiate analgesic use (AQA score) will be assessed at timelines specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  The average daily OME will require at least 4 days of data and will be used to assign the AQA score.  An increase of 1 point or more in the AQA score from a starting value of 1 or higher OR \u2265 2 points in AQA score from a starting value of 0 is considered a clinically meaningful increase in opiate use.  Similarly, a decrease of 1 point or more in the AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher is considered a clinically meaningful decrease in opiate use. 8.1.8.10  Administration of PRO Questionnaires The PRO instruments will be self-administered at home by the participants using handheld devices at the time points indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Participants may complete the ePROs at study sites if the assessment time point coincides with a scheduled site visit; otherwise, participants may complete the ePROs at home.  The analgesic use log using the ERT Medication Module\u2122 will also be administered electronically alongside the ePROs.  If there is a technical issue with the device, the site will have access to a web-based back up. Each site must allocate the responsibility for the administration of the ePRO instruments to a specific individual (eg, a research nurse or study coordinator) and, if possible, assign a backup person to cover if that individual is absent. Approximately 15 to 30 minutes is required for participants to complete the questionnaires. The below instructions should be followed when collecting PRO data via an electronic device: PRO questionnaires completed at site visits must be completed prior to treatment administration and ideally before any discussions of health status to avoid biasing the participant's responses to the questions.  As feasible, site staff should also ensure PRO questionnaires are completed prior to other study procedures, such as collection of laboratory samples, to further minimise bias. When each instrument is due to be completed, the following order will be observed: BPI-SF, BFI, Analgesic Log, FACT-P, PGIS, EQ-5D-5L, and then PRO-CTCAE. PRO questionnaires should be completed by the participant in a quiet and private location. The participant should be given sufficient time to complete the questionnaires at their own speed. The research nurse or appointed site staff must explain to participants the value and relevance of ePRO participation, so they are motivated to comply with questionnaire completion.  Inform the participant that these questions are being asked to find out, directly from them, how they feel. The research nurse or appointed site staff should stress that the information is not routinely shared with study staff. Therefore, if the participant has any medical problems, they should discuss them with the doctor or research nurse separately from the ePRO assessment. The research nurse or appointed site staff must train the participant on how to use the PRO device, using the materials and training provided by the ePRO vendor. The research nurse or appointed site staff must provide guidance on whom to call if there are problems with the device if the participant is completing the ePRO at home. All questionnaires must be completed using the ePRO device; paper questionnaires are not allowed in this study. The research nurse or appointed site staff must remind participants there are no right or wrong answers and avoid introducing bias by not clarifying items for the participant. The participant should not receive help from relatives, friends, or clinic staff to respond to the ePRO questionnaires.  The responses are the participant's alone. On completion of the questionnaire at the site, the device should be handed back to the designated responsible person, who should check that all questionnaires were completed. If a participant uses visual aids (eg, spectacles or contact lenses) for reading and does not have them when he or she attends the clinic, the participant will be exempted from completing the ePROs at that clinic visit, though they can complete them at home if within the allowable window. Site staff must not read or complete the ePRO questionnaires on behalf of the participant.  If the participant is unable to read the questionnaire (eg, is blind or illiterate), that participant is exempted from completing PRO questionnaires but may still participate in the study.  If the participant cannot complete the ePRO questionnaires due to other than being blind or illiterate, the AstraZeneca study team must be contacted to determine if they can be exempted.  This includes requirements for screening questionnaires.  Participants exempted in this regard should be flagged appropriately by the site staff in the source documents and in the Review of PRO\/Questionnaire\/Diary (REVPRDI) eCRF. Site staff must administer questionnaires available in the language that the participant speaks and understands.  Questions should not be read in an available language and translated into another language for the participant. It is vital that the ePRO reporting is conducted at the Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1 visit, as specified in the SoA.  The participant should bring the device to every site visit so the site can confirm the device is functioning properly.  It is especially critical the participant bring the device to the Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1 visit so not to miss the assessments that have baseline at this visit.  The ePRO device must be charged and fully functional at the beginning of the baseline visit to ensure that the PROs can be completed at the start of the visit. Finally, the research nurse or appointed site staff will review the completion status of questionnaires during site visits and document the reason(s) why a participant could not complete assessments either in the REVPRDI eCRF or the device depending on the set-up for the study. Reminders should be sent to the participant at home as needed to ensure compliance with the assessment schedules.  The research nurse or appointed site staff must monitor compliance, since minimising missing data is a key aspect of study success.  It is important that the PRO device is charged and fully functional.  Compliance must be checked at each study visit and should be checked more frequently to identify problems early.  If compliance drops below 88%, they will be flagged in the routine compliance report generated by the ePRO system, and a check-in call from the study site to ask the participant if he or she has any difficulties is highly recommended.  A solution to enhance\/resolve compliance should be discussed with the participant.  Discussions and compliance review should be reflected in source documents. 8.1.8.11  Unify Mobile Software Application The electronic device containing the PRO instruments will also contain a Unify mobile software application.  The Unify mobile software application, and associated website system, will provide digital support to patients from screening through to, and including, follow-up.  The system will provide patients and site study staff with information and tools relevant to the conduct of the study in accordance with this CSP.  This will comprise treatment medication reminders, clinical visit reminders, and educational content relating to the disease and medication. 8.2  Safety Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Section 1.3). 8.2.1  Physical Examinations The physical examination will be performed at timelines as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3) and will include an assessment of the following: general appearance, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdomen skin, head and neck (including ears, eyes, nose and throat), lymph nodes, thyroid, musculoskeletal (including spine and extremities) and neurological systems. Weight and height will be assessed at timelines as specified in the SoA. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses, new or worsening abnormalities may qualify as AEs. 8.2.2  Vital Signs Vital signs (including blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature) will be assessed at timelines as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed with a completely automated device.  Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones). Vital signs will be measured in a supine position after 10 minutes rest and will include temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse.  Three readings of blood pressure and pulse will be taken and should be reported in the participant's notes.  The first reading should be rejected.  The second and third readings should be averaged to give the measurement to be recorded in the eCRF. 8.2.3  Electrocardiograms Triplicate 12-lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (Section 1.3). All ECGs to be conducted as triplicate measurements, within approximately 5 minutes of starting (the 3 ECGs separated by approximately 2 minutes).  Assessments should be performed as close as possible to, but within 30 minutes of the nominal time point. The timing and number of ECGs may be altered depending on the emerging PK and safety profile.  Additional ECGs may be taken at the discretion of the investigator. Twelve-lead ECGs will be obtained after the participant has been resting semi-supine for at least 10 minutes prior to the times indicated.  All ECGs should be recorded with the participant in the same physical position.  A standardised ECG machine should be used and the participant should be examined using the same machine throughout the study if possible. After paper ECGs have been recorded, the investigator or designated physician will review each of the ECGs and may refer to a local cardiologist if appropriate.  A paper copy should be filed in the participant's medical records. If an abnormal ECG finding at screening or baseline is considered clinically significant by the investigator, it should be reported as a concurrent condition.  For all ECGs, details of intervals PR, R-R, QRS, QT, and QTcF and an overall evaluation will be recorded (normal; abnormal, non-clinically significant or abnormal, clinically significant). 8.2.4  Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis will be taken at the visits indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3). Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator.  The date, time of collection and results (values, units, and reference ranges) will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. The clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis will be performed at a local laboratory at or near to the investigator site.  Sample tubes and sample sizes may vary depending on laboratory method used and routine practice at the site. Laboratory values that meet the criteria for CTCAE grade 3 or have changed significantly from baseline and are considered to be of clinical concern will be repeated\/confirmed within 7 days and followed up as appropriate. The investigator should assess the available results with regard to clinically relevant abnormalities.  The laboratory results should be signed and dated and retained at centre as source data for laboratory variables.  For information on how AEs based on laboratory tests should be recorded and reported, see Section 8.3.6. Table 7 lists the clinical safety laboratory variables to be measured.

On blood glucose assessment days (incorporating clinical chemistry and glucose) it is requested that participants refrain from caloric intake for \u2265 4 hours prior to the morning dose of study treatment. Glucose (fasting) is to be measured at screening, pre-dose; at 1 hour and 4 hours post-dose in Cycle 1, Day 1; pre-dose on Cycle 1, Day 15; pre-dose in Cycle 2, Day 1; and at discontinuation of study treatment. Further glucose monitoring may be performed at the investigator's discretion in Cycles 1 and 2 based on the participant's characteristics (ie, diabetes or high risk of hyperglycaemia), and in Cycle 3 onwards based on results during Cycles 1 and 2. HbA1c is to be measured at screening, every 16 weeks from Cycle 1, Day 1, and at discontinuation of study treatment. Note: in addition to the fasted glucose assessments identified in the SoA (Section 1.3), random glucose measurements are to be performed (and recorded) as part of the standard clinical chemistry assessments throughout the study. 8.2.4.2  Serum Creatinine After Cycle 2 onwards, participants taking capivasertib\/placebo and metformin in combination should have creatinine assessments conducted as part of the routine clinical chemistry with additional monitoring of creatinine at the discretion of the investigator. 8.2.5  MUGA Scan\/Echocardiogram Assessments will be performed at screening and thereafter as clinically indicated.  Bidimensional echocardiography (Echo) is the preferred modality because of the global technetium [Tc-99m] shortage (but MUGA can be used alternatively). The modality of the cardiac function assessments must be consistent within participant, ie, if echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment and a follow-up assessment if clinically indicated, then echocardiogram should also be used for subsequent scans if required.  The participant should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible. 8.3  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The Principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix H. AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorised representative). The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE.  For information on how to follow up AEs see Section 8.3.2. 8.3.1  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information Adverse events, including SAEs, will be collected from time of signature of the ICF, throughout the treatment period and including the 30-day follow-up period after discontinuation of study drug.  * *In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs\/SAEs must be reported. If the investigator becomes aware of a SAE with a suspected causal relationship to the IMP that occurs after the end of the clinical study in a participant treated by him or her, the investigator shall, without undue delay, report the SAE to the sponsor. 8.3.2  Follow-up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE\/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits\/contacts.  All SAEs\/non-serious AEs (as defined in Appendix H), will be followed until resolution, stabilisation, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up. A post-study assessment will be performed preferably within 7 days of the time that the IMP is permanently discontinued. Safety follow-up should be carried out with the participant 30 days (+ 7 days) after the discontinuation of study treatment to follow-up any SAEs\/AEs and concomitant medications (including any subsequent cancer therapy). Any AE\/SAE\/abnormal laboratory findings that are ongoing at the time of study treatment discontinuation or any new treatment related events within 30 days of study treatment, must be followed up to resolution or until the event becomes stable (or returns to baseline) or is unlikely to resolve further in the opinion of the investigator. Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant's last AE assessment or other assessment\/visit as appropriate in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF.  AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any participant with ongoing AE(s)\/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 8.3.3  Adverse Event Variables The following variables will be collected for each AE: AE (verbatim) The date when the AE started and stopped CTCAE grade and changes in CTCAE grade Whether the AE is serious or not Investigator causality rating against the IMP(s) (yes or no) Action taken with regard to IMP(s) AE caused participant's withdrawal from study (yes or no) Outcome. In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: Date AE met criteria for serious AE Date investigator became aware of SAE AE is serious due to Date of hospitalisation Date of discharge Probable cause of death Date of death Autopsy performed Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) Causality assessment to other medication 8.3.4  Causality Collection The investigator should assess the causal relationship between the IMP and each AE, and answer \u2018yes' or \u2018no' to the question \u2018Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?' For SAEs, causal relationship should also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as \u2018yes'. A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix H. 8.3.5  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the participant or reported in response to the open question from the study site staff (eg, \u2018Have you had any health problems since the previous visit\/you were last asked?'), or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF.  When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 8.3.6  Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests The results from the CSP-mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG abnormalities should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria, are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product or are considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the investigator (which may include but not limited to consideration as to whether treatment or non-planned visits were required or other action was taken with the study treatment, eg, dose adjustment or drug interruption). If deterioration in a laboratory value\/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result\/vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE\/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally related to the disease under study (see Section 8.3.8). 8.3.7  Hy's Law Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT \u2265 3xULN together with total bilirubin \u2265 2xULN may need to be reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix G for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy's Law. 8.3.8  Disease Progression Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a participant's condition attributable to the disease for which the investigational product is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and\/or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The development of new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events that are unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an AE during the study. 8.3.9  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational product, or to the study procedure(s)*.  All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. *In Screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting). If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately.  investigators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the EDC system, an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the EDC system is not available, then the investigator or other study site staff reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the investigator\/study site staff how to proceed. For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix H. The reference document for definition of expectedness\/listedness for capivasertib is the current IB; for abiraterone, the local prescribing information is the reference document for definition of expectedness\/listedness. 8.3.10  Pregnancy Paternal Exposure Participants should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 16 weeks following the last dose of capivasertib\/placebo. Pregnancy of the participants' partners is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until 16 weeks after the last dose should, if possible, be followed up and documented. 8.3.11  Medication Error If a medication error occurs in the course of the study, then the investigator or other site personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is completed within 1 (Initial Fatal\/Life-Threatening or follow up Fatal\/Life-Threatening) or 5 (other serious initial and follow up) calendar days if there is an SAE associated with the medication error (see Section 8.3.9) and within 30 days for all other medication errors. The definition of a Medication Error can be found in Appendix H 4. 8.3.12  Management of Capivasertib-related Toxicities 8.3.12.1  Capivasertib\/Placebo Dose Modification and Guidance Please refer to Section 6.6 for guidance on dose modifications. 8.3.12.2  Dose Modifications due to General Capivasertib-related Toxicities Treatment with capivasertib\/placebo should be temporarily interrupted for any intolerable AE regardless of grade or for any AEs grade \u2265 3 that occurs despite optimal supportive care, are not attributable to the disease under investigation, where the investigator considers the AE of concern to be specifically associated with capivasertib.  Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related toxicities are shown in Table 8.  Appropriate and optimal treatment of the toxicity is assumed prior to considering dose modifications.  The Study Physician may be consulted prior to discontinuation of study drug due to toxicities.  Please see Section 8.3.12.3 for the management of capivasertib-specific toxicities including hyperglycaemia, maculo-papular rash and other skin reactions, and diarrhoea.

In participants who are diabetic, it may be beneficial to rule out concomitant aetiologies that could be associated with hyperglycaemia (eg, infections, dehydration, vascular events, glucocorticoids). Participants should be made aware of symptoms of hyperglycaemia (eg, polydipsia and polyuria). Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related hyperglycaemia are shown in Table 9.  In addition, for all grades, participants may receive education on lifestyle changes (eg, a diabetic diet) and consider beginning home glucose monitoring (eg, fasting self-blood glucose monitoring once daily) at the discretion of the investigator.  If glucose home monitoring is instituted, the capivasertib\/placebo treatment decision should be based on the morning fasting glucose value obtained prior to the dose of capivasertib\/placebo. It is recommended that approaches to the management of capivasertib-induced hyperglycaemia include advice from a diabetologist where appropriate (eg, participants with diabetes).  Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies (see below for further guidance).  If a second agent is required, consideration should be given to the intermittent schedule of capivasertib and the pattern of glucose changes (eg, sulphonylureas should be avoided due to the risk of hypoglycaemia secondary to their mechanism of action).

NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0; SBGM, self-blood glucose monitoring. Use of metformin Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies.  Investigators should exercise caution in the dosing and management of participants receiving the metformin and capivasertib\/placebo combination and must be vigilant for signs of renal impairment and metformin toxicity, such as lactic acidosis and hypoglycaemia, namely: lethargy, hypotension, poor urine output, drowsiness, irritation, tachypnoea, sweating, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Due to the potential interaction of metformin and capivasertib (caused by the inhibition of renal transporters [eg, OCT2] involved in the excretion of metformin), when taking both capivasertib and metformin concurrently, participants should attend the clinic for monitoring of serum creatinine at least once per week for the first 3 weeks after initiation of metformin, then every 3 weeks thereafter. Metformin should only be given on the days when capivasertib\/placebo is also administered (the half-life of capivasertib is approximately 7 to 15 hours) and should be withdrawn when treatment with capivasertib\/placebo is withdrawn, unless otherwise clinically indicated. Consider withholding of metformin on the days when participants are due to have imaging with contrast (in order to reduce the already low risk of lactic acidosis) as per local guidelines. Maculo-papular Rash Dose modifications for capivasertib-related maculo-papular rash, which is the most frequent skin toxicity observed in participants treated with capivasertib, are provided in Table 10.  However, these management guidelines can be used for other skin toxicities at the discretion of the investigator and\/or following consultation with the dermatologist.

BSA, body surface area; NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. Hypersensitivity In the case of hypersensitivity reactions, capivasertib\/placebo should be discontinued, and symptomatic\/supportive therapy should be initiated (including with antihistamines and\/or steroids) as considered appropriate by the investigator\/treating physician.  Drug re-challenge is not recommended; any subsequent consideration on re-challenge with capivasertib at the same or a lower dose, with its potential for recurrence of such or more severe events should be carefully considered against the potential benefits to the individual participant from continuation of capivasertib therapy and agreed with the sponsor.  Further management should follow local guidelines on management of hypersensitivity reactions. Diarrhoea Participants should be instructed to promptly contact investigators if they develop diarrhoea. Alternative aetiologies should be ruled out prior to initiating the dose modifications.  Investigators are recommended to prescribe anti-diarrhoeal treatment at the first visit so that participants can start treatment at the first sign of diarrhoea, should it occur.  Loperamide is the preferred anti-diarrhoeal agent for the management of diarrhoea occurring in participants participating in studies of capivasertib.  If diarrhoea is reported, additional details regarding this AE will be collected in the eCRF. Dose modifications for capivasertib-related diarrhoea are provided in Table 11.

NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. 8.4  Overdose There is currently no specific treatment in the event of an overdose with capivasertib and possible symptoms of overdose are not established.  Capivasertib must only be used in accordance with the relevant CSP.  AEs associated with overdose should be treated in response to symptoms.  Any dose, or frequency of dosing, that exceeds the dose regimen specified in the CSP should be reported as an overdose.  The maximum tolerated dose for capivasertib is 480 mg BD as monotherapy.  Abiraterone must be used according to local prescribing information. Adverse reactions associated with overdose should be treated symptomatically and should be managed appropriately. An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis\/symptoms on the relevant AE modules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module. An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose eCRF module. If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study drug occurs in the course of the study, the investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives immediately, but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 or 5 calendar days for overdoses associated with an SAE (see Section 8.3.9) and within 30 days for all other overdoses. 8.5  Human Biological Samples Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided in the study specific laboratory manual.  Samples should be stored in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  For further details on Handling of Human Biological Samples see Appendix I. Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years from the date of the issue of the CSR in line with consent and local requirements, after which they will be destroyed\/repatriated. PK samples will be disposed of after the Bioanalytical Report finalisation or 6 months after issuance of the draft Bioanalytical Report (whichever is earlier), unless consented for future analyses. PK samples may be disposed of or anonymised by pooling.  Additional analyses may be conducted on the anonymised, pooled PK samples to further evaluate and validate the analytical method.  Any results from such analyses may be reported separately from the CSR.  Anonymised samples will be retained for no more than 5 years after the CSR is finalised. 8.5.1  Pharmacokinetics Blood samples of approximately 2 mL will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of capivasertib as specified in the SoA (Table 2). Samples from participants dosed with placebo will not be analysed (for exceptions, see Section 8.5.1.1).  The randomisation code will be supplied to the bioanalytics team before sample analysis. Results will only be reported for samples shipped within a timeframe for which the stability of capivasertib in the samples has been validated and shown to be acceptable. Samples may be collected at additional time points during the study if warranted and agreed upon between the investigator and the sponsor (eg, for safety reasons).  Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided by the sponsor or analytical test site.  The actual date and time (24-hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded.  The timing of sampling may be altered during the course of the study based on newly available data (eg, to obtain data closer to the time of peak or trough matrix concentrations) to ensure appropriate monitoring. Samples collected for analysis of capivasertib plasma concentrations may also be used to evaluate safety or efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or after the study. Samples will be collected, labelled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual. 8.5.1.1  Determination of Drug Concentration Samples for determination of capivasertib concentration in plasma will be assayed by bioanalytical test sites operated by or on behalf of Clinical Bioanalysis Alliance, AstraZeneca, using an appropriately validated bioanalytical method.  Full details of the analytical method used will be described in a separate bioanalytical report. For each participant in the placebo arm, samples will only be analysed on a \u2018for cause' basis, eg, if no quantifiable concentrations were observed in a participant's samples when the drug was expected to be present. Drug concentration information that may unblind the study will not be reported to investigative sites or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded. Incurred sample reproducibility analysis, if any, will be performed alongside the bioanalysis of the test samples.  The results from the evaluation, if performed, will be reported in a separate Bioanalytical Report. Additional analyses may be conducted on the biological samples to further investigate the presence and\/or identity of drug metabolites.  Any results from such analyses may be reported separately from the CSR. 8.5.2  Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics will not form part of this study. 8.6  Human Biological Sample Biomarkers 8.6.1  Collection of Mandatory Samples for Biomarker Analysis By consenting to participate in the study the subject consents to participate in the mandatory research components of the study. Samples for biomarker research are required and will be collected from all participants in this study as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). Mandatory Tumour Samples Tumour tissue samples from either the primary or metastatic sites (excluding bone metastases and FNA samples), taken as part of routine clinical practice, will be provided for assessment of PTEN status by IHC.  Determination of PTEN status is a requirement for recruitment and only patients with PTEN deficiency as detected by central testing using the Investigational Use Only (IUO) PTEN IHC assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, USA) will be enrolled.  This sample needs to be provided for screening Part 1, and should preferably be a representative FFPE tissue block, that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides, or if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides from the most recently collected tumour tissue.  Further details on tissue specifications are outlined in the Laboratory Manual and the Pathology Testing Manual.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1. In addition to being used for determination of eligibility for this study, the PTEN IHC results are also planned to be used for companion diagnostic test development.  Based on availability of tissue, additional diagnostic test development may be conducted and\/or further additional exploratory biomarkers may be evaluated, which may include but are not limited to, genomic analysis of tumour tissue to identify markers of response and resistance to study drugs.  For this purpose, an optional tumour sample (FFPE block [preferred] or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections) can be provided in screening Part 1.  For screening Part 2, eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) will be required to provide an additional tumour sample (FFPE block [preferred] or 20 [minimum 15] freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  Participants who provided optional additional tumour tissue in screening Part 1 are exempt from providing tumour in screening Part 2.  If fewer slides are available, the patient may still be eligible for the study, after discussion with and approval by the Medical Monitor.  Further details on tissue specifications are outlined in the Laboratory Manual.  China participants will not participate in these exploratory analyses. Mandatory Blood Samples for Exploratory Biomarker Analysis Blood samples will be collected for analysis of ctDNA (see Section 1.3).  The ctDNA samples collected at screening will be analysed for predictive biomarkers of response to treatment and may be used to develop and validate future in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests.  Several ctDNA samples will be taken during treatment and a final sample will be taken at disease progression.  These samples will be used for additional exploratory research which may include but is not limited to interrogation of changes in genetic alterations and potential mechanisms of resistance to treatment. For exploratory biomarker research, blood samples will be collected to provide plasma for circulating soluble factors and whole blood samples will be collected for DNA and RNA biomarkers.  These samples will be taken at multiple timepoints and analysed for a range of oncology and immunological biomarkers that may correlate with drug response.  These biomarkers may include, but are not limited to, panels of cytokines, chemokines and other soluble biomarkers; T-cell receptor repertoire analysis and analysis of gene expression biomarkers associated with immunomodulatory effects. Blood samples for the enumeration of CTCs using CellSearch assay will be collected at baseline, pre-treatment on Cycle 4\/Day 1, and at disease progression.  Blood samples will also be collected at Cycle 1\/Day 1 and on progression for the analysis of biomarkers detectable in CTCs using Epic Sciences assays. Details of sample collection, processing, shipping and storage are detailed in the Laboratory Manual. Blood samples for ctDNA testing, exploratory biomarker research, and CTC testing will not be collected from participants in China. 8.6.2  Collection of Optional Biomarker Samples Participants will sign an informed consent for the optional tumour tissue biopsies. Where possible, every effort should be made to collect optional samples for biomarker research from consenting patients in the study, as outlined in the SoA (see Section 1.3) and as follows: Paired biopsies: a baseline biopsy taken before the initial dosing of study drug at screening or pre-dose on Cycle 1, Day 1, and a biopsy taken on-treatment.  The on-treatment biopsy should be taken at least 4 hours post-dose between Cycle 1, Day 16 and Cycle 1, Day 18.  Biopsies should preferably be collected from the same tumour site.  The exact day, time and site of biopsy collection should be clearly noted in the associated documentation. An additional biopsy obtained at termination of treatment\/disease progression, if applicable. The tumour biopsy procedure will be performed by core needle, under radiological guidance, or surgically if the site of disease is superficial and palpable or visible.  It is mandated that the core biopsy be removed directly from the tumour in situ and not cored from a surgically removed tumour.  This is to ensure the best possible quality of the biopsy, so the blood\/nutrient supply to the tumour is not disrupted prior to biopsy collection.  Collection of tumour cells from fluid such as ascites or pleural effusion is not permitted.  The tumour samples may be analysed for biomarkers including, but not limited to, markers of PI3K\/AKT and AR pathways and treatment-induced changes in immunological markers such as CD8 expressing T-cells and PD-L1 expression. Collection of optional biomarker samples is not applicable for participants in China. 8.6.3  Other Study-related Biomarker Research Already collected samples may be analysed on different biomarkers thought to play a role in prostate cancer including, but not limited to, analysis of tumour tissue and peripheral blood samples for immunological biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression, TCR sequencing and gene expression analysis; chemokines and cytokines, and analysis of genes associated with AKT\/AR signalling in tumour tissue and ctDNA to evaluate their association with observed clinical responses to study drug.  For storage, re-use and destruction of biomarker samples see Section 8.5. 8.7  Optional Genomics Initiative Sample Collection of optional samples for genomics initiative research is also part of this study as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3) and is subject to agreement in the ICF addendum. A 6 mL blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected from participants who have consented to participate in the genetic analysis component of the study.  Participation is optional.  Participants who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the study. Note: Samples for genomics initiative research will not be collected for participants in China. See Appendix J for information regarding the Genomics Initiative genetic sample, including storage and destruction of genetic samples. 8.8  Medical Resource Utilisation and Health Economics The impact of treatment and disease on healthcare resource use will be captured in this study on an event-driven basis. The Hospital Admission (HOSPAD) module will be used to collect information on key health care resource use beyond study-mandated visits.  The site should complete the HOSPAD form at the site at every scheduled clinic visit up to and including the post study treatment discontinuation follow-up visit.  If a participant discontinues study treatment for reasons other than RECIST or PCWG3 progression, the HOSPAD form should continue to be administered until progression has been confirmed.  Study-mandated visits should not be included as a hospital admission. The data may be used as input to cost analyses for example cost utility analysis or cost effectiveness analysis."

          "Section":"8.1 Efficacy Assessments",
          "Text":"8.1  Efficacy Assessments 8.1.1  Tumour Assessments Tumour assessments will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and a bone scan for whole body.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before randomisation, and ideally, should be performed as close as possible to randomisation.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) relative to the date of randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), regardless of discontinuation of study treatment (eg, discontinuation due to toxicity or clinical progression) or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy. The assessments by different imaging modalities (eg, CT and bone scintigraphy) can be done on different days but should all be performed within the assessment schedule.  It is important to follow the imaging assessment schedule as closely as possible; however, tumour assessment can be performed at any time when disease progression is clinically suspected.  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged.  If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at the participant's scheduled visits. Participants who discontinue study treatment prior to progression should continue to be scanned until progression.  The same imaging modality and the same assessment (eg, the same contrast protocol for CT scans) should be performed at baseline and at all follow-up time points. Radiological examinations performed during the study should be retained at site as source data. 8.1.2  Evaluation of Disease Progression 8.1.2.1  Radiographic PFS Radiographic PFS is defined as the time from randomisation to: 1) radiographic progression, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), or 2) death due to any cause regardless of whether the participant withdraws from randomised treatment or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression. Radiographic PFS will be measured by investigator assessment, and a sensitivity analysis of PFS assessed by BICR will also be conducted (see Section 8.1.2.4). The definitions of measurable, non-measurable, target and non-target lesions for assessment of soft tissue using RECIST 1.1 criteria, methods of assessment, and the objective tumour response criteria are provided in Appendix E 2.  The PCWG3 guidelines are provided in Appendix E 3. Participants who have not progressed, as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) or PCWG3 criteria (bone), or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 assessment.  However, if the participant progresses or dies immediately after 2 or more consecutive missed visits, the participant will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 bone assessment prior to the 2 missed visits. 8.1.2.2  Evaluation of Soft Tissue Lesions The criteria for objective tumour response on soft tissue lesions will be based on RECIST 1.1: CR (complete response), PR (partial response), SD (stable disease), PD (progressive disease), NE (not evaluable), and NED (no evidence of disease). For participants with measurable lesion at baseline, target lesion progression will be calculated in reference to the smallest tumour burden on study (ie, the smallest sum of diameters previously recorded on study).  In the absence of progression, target lesion response will be calculated using as reference the baseline tumour measurements obtained before starting treatment.  For these participants, the objective tumour response assessment options are CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE. For participants with non-measurable soft tissue lesions only at baseline, the objective tumour response assessment options are CR, PD, Non CR\/Non PD, and NE. For participants with bone lesions only and no soft tissue disease at baseline, the objective tumour response assessment options will be NED, PD (if a new soft tissue lesion appears), or NE (if the scan is not performed). If the investigator is in doubt as to whether disease progression has occurred, particularly with regard to non-target lesions or the appearance of a new lesion, it is advisable to continue treatment and reassess the tumour burden at the next scheduled assessment or sooner if clinically indicated.  If repeat scans confirm progression, then the date of the initial scan should be declared as the date of progression.  New bone lesions should not be counted in the RECIST assessment. To achieve \u2018unequivocal progression' on the basis of non-target lesions, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest \u2018increase' in the size of 1 or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. 8.1.2.3  Evaluation of Bone Lesions Progression on a bone scan is identified using PCWG3 criteria, by having 2 or more new metastatic bone lesions. For participants without progression at the first visit after baseline, the scan from this first visit after baseline now serves as new reference for all subsequent scans, ie, assuming all visits are acquired according to schedule, all bone scans after Week 16 are compared to the Week 16 scan. The requirements for determination of radiographic progression by either bone scan (bone progression) or CT\/MRI (soft tissue progression) are summarised in Table 6.

Images, including unscheduled visit scans, will be collected on an ongoing basis and sent to an AstraZeneca-appointed imaging Contract Research Organisation (iCRO) for QC, storage, and for BICR.  Digital copies of all original scans should be stored at the investigator site as source documents.  Electronic image transfer from the sites to the iCRO is strongly encouraged.  A BICR of images will be performed at the discretion of AstraZeneca.  Results of these independent reviews will not be communicated to investigators, and results of investigator tumour assessments will not be shared with the central reviewers.  The management of participants will be based solely upon the results of the RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and PCWG3 (bone) assessment conducted by the investigator. All treatment decisions will be based on site assessment of scans.  After the primary rPFS analysis, central review of scans will no longer be required, and investigators will be advised when to stop sending copies of the scans to the CRO conducting the central review. 8.1.2.5  PFS2 PFS2 is defined as the time from randomisation until progression on next-line treatment (ie, the line of treatment following the first progression in the study), as clinical progression, PSA progression, or radiographic progression determined by RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone) as assessed by the investigator, or death due to any cause.  Censoring details will be defined in the SAP. A participant will enter the PFS2 follow-up period once that participant has discontinued study treatment due to progressive disease by RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue lesions and\/or PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions. The participant's status at first progression will be used as the reference for assessment of PFS2. RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 assessments will not be collected for assessment of PFS2. The date of PFS2 assessment and the investigator's opinion of progression status (progressed or non-progressed) at each assessment will be recorded in the eCRF.  Determination of progressive disease for PFS2 will be by institutional call. 8.1.3  Overall Survival Overall survival is the length of time from randomisation until the date of death due to any cause.  In the survival follow-up period, all subsequent cancer therapies and vital status will be documented at least every 12 weeks until death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first. Any participant not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the participant was known to be alive. Survival information may be obtained via telephone contact with the participant, participant's family, by contact with the participant's current physician, or local death registries as described in Section 7.3. Survival calls will be made in the week following the date of DCO for each of the rPFS or OS analyses.  If participants are confirmed to be alive or if the death date is after the DCO date, these participants will be censored at the date of DCO. 8.1.4  Time to PSA Progression Time to PSA progression is defined as the time from randomisation to PSA progression, as determined by PCWG3 criteria: PSA progression is the date that an increase of 25% or more and absolute increase of 2 ng\/mL or more from the nadir are documented, which is confirmed by a second value obtained 3 or more weeks later.  Censoring details for this endpoint will be defined in the SAP. Blood samples for PSA measurements will be collected and evaluated by the local testing laboratory at timelines as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  These assessments should continue until disease progression, regardless of discontinuation of study treatment. 8.1.5  Time to First Subsequent Therapy Time to First Subsequent Therapy (TFST) is defined as time from randomisation to the earlier of start date of the first subsequent anticancer therapy after discontinuation of randomised treatment, or death due to any cause. All anticancer treatments (including, but not limited to, chemotherapy and targeted agents), and the investigator's opinion of response to these treatments plus the date of progression, following discontinuation of study treatment, must be recorded.  Subsequent systemic anticancer therapies (excluding radiotherapy) will be reviewed prior to data unblinding to assess which represent clinically important treatments intended to control prostate cancer.  Any participant not known to have died at the time of the analysis and not known to have had a further anticancer therapy will be censored at the last known time to have not received subsequent therapy, ie, the last follow-up visit where this was confirmed. 8.1.6  SSE-FS Symptomatic skeletal event-free survival (SSE-FS) is defined as the time from randomisation until any of the following (or death due to any cause): Use of radiation therapy to prevent or relieve skeletal symptoms. Occurrence of new symptomatic pathological bone fractures (vertebral or non-vertebral).  Radiologic documentation is required.  A pathological fracture, as determined by investigator, is defined as associated with low or no trauma and deemed to have occurred at a site of bone metastasis. Occurrence of spinal cord compression.  Radiologic documentation is required. Orthopaedic surgical intervention for bone metastasis. Participants who have not experienced any of the above conditions will be censored at the time of the last SSE assessment. Assessments for symptomatic skeletal events will be performed at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 1.3), and should continue beyond disease progression, regardless of discontinuation of study treatment. 8.1.7  Time to Castration Resistance Time to castration resistance (TTCR) is defined as the time from randomisation to the first castration-resistant event (radiographic disease progression, PSA progression, or SSE), whichever occurs first, at castrate levels of testosterone (below 50 ng\/dL).  Censoring details will be defined in the SAP. The timepoints of assessments for radiographic progression and SSEs, and collection of samples for determination of PSA and serum testosterone levels are indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3). 8.1.8  Patient-reported Outcomes A clinical outcome assessment (COA) is an assessment of a clinical outcome reported by a clinician, a patient, or a non-clinician observer, or through a performance-based assessment (FDA-NIH BEST Resource).  A COA may be used in clinical studies to provide either direct or indirect evidence of treatment benefit.  It is important to examine the impact of therapy on disease-related symptoms, physical function, and other HRQoL of the patient to aid understanding of how clinical benefit relates to patient well-being and for consideration in making risk-benefit evaluations.  PRO is one type of clinical outcome assessment and is a general term referring to all outcomes and symptoms that are directly reported by the patient.  Moreover, PROs assist in the documentation of symptoms and specifically what symptoms and impacts are most important to patients and how these relate to clinical outcomes.  PROs have become important in evaluating effectiveness of study treatments in clinical studies and will aid in understanding of the benefit\/risk evaluation (Kluetz et al 2018).  The following PROs will be administered in this study: BPI-SF, BFI, FACT-P, PGIS, EQ-5D-5L, and selected questions from the PRO-CTCAE items library.  Samples of the PRO questionnaires are provided in Appendix F.  PROs will be administered according to the SoA (Section 1.3).  PROs will be provided in the native language(s) of the country in which they will be administered, except for PRO-CTCAE, which will only be administered in the languages where a linguistically validated version is available. 8.1.8.1  BPI-SF The BPI-SF (Appendix F 1) is a validated, 15-item domain-specific instrument designed to assess the severity of pain and the impact\/interference of pain on daily functions (Cleeland and Ryan 1994).  The BPI-SF will be scored according to the user guide (Cleeland 2009).  All BPI-SF pain items including \u2018worst pain' is scored on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS) with 0 = No Pain and 10 = Worst Pain Imaginable.  This instrument consists of 2 domains: pain severity and pain interference.  The pain severity domain consists of 4 items (Item 3, Item 4, Item 5, and Item 6) which assess pain at its \u2018worst,' \u2018least,' \u2018average,' and \u2018now' (current pain) respectively on the 11-point NRS.  These 4 items may be averaged as a composite pain severity score or they may be interpreted individually (Dworkin et al 2005, Dworkin et al 2008, FDA 2009, Turk et al 2006).  In this study, the \u2018worst pain' (Item 3) will be used as a single item in assessing pain progression.  A composite pain severity score from all the 4 items will also be evaluated.  A 2- or more point change in the \u2018worst pain' item is considered clinically meaningful. The pain interference domain score is a mean of 7 items: general activity (Item 9A), mood (Item 9B), walking ability (Item 9C), normal work (Item 9D), relations with other people (Item 9E), sleep (Item 9F), and enjoyment of life (Item 9G), each scored on an 11-point NRS from 0 (Does not interfere) to 10 (Completely interferes).  Based on the BPI-SF scoring manual, the following items are not used in scoring pain severity or pain interference domains: Items 1, 2, 7, and 8.  Item 7 (a free text field) describing pain medication use is captured separately in more detail using the analgesic log. The BPI-SF analgesic log (captured on ePRO device) will be completed by the participant as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Further details on the analgesic log and scoring are provided in Sections 8.1.8.8 and 8.1.8.9, respectively. Time to pain progression is a key secondary endpoint of this study (see Section 8.1.8.2).  In addition, change from baseline in pain severity and pain interference domain scores may be derived. 8.1.8.2  Time to Pain Progression The key secondary endpoint of TTPP is defined as the time from randomisation to the time point at which clinically meaningful pain progression is observed, based on a 2-point increase from baseline in the BPI-SF Item 3 \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' score and\/or initiation of\/increase in opiate analgesic use.  A minimum of 4 days of data is required.  The criteria for pain progression depend on whether a participant is asymptomatic or symptomatic at baseline: Asymptomatic participants at baseline (average BPI-SF Item 3 score of 0 and not taking opioids) Increase of 2 or more points in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' (BPI-SF Item 3) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks) OR Initiation of opioid use for pain Symptomatic participants at baseline (average BPI-SF Item 3 score > 0 and\/or currently taking opioids) Increase of 2 or more points in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' (BPI-SF Item 3) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks) and an average worst pain score \u2265 4, and no decrease in average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or more points decrease in AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher OR Increase in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or more points increase (or at least 2 points increase if the starting value is 0) in the AQA score from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks). Participants satisfying one or more of the criteria above will be considered to have pain progression.  Participants who do not satisfy any of the criteria above will be censored at the time of the last known assessment that showed an absence of pain progression. Censoring A number of situations will lead to a participant's time to pain progression being censored; these are as follows: If a participant meets the criteria for pain progression after 2 or more missed visits (visits which showed < 4 days of BPI-SF worst pain [Item 3] assessments and the average AQA score does not meet the progression criteria), then the participant will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used). Participants who have not met the criteria for pain progression at the time of analysis: The censoring date will be the date of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used). Participants with no evaluable baseline or post-baseline data will be censored at Day 1. For participants who receive subsequent anticancer therapy: The censoring date will be the date of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment prior to the start date of subsequent anticancer therapy (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used) Participants with no evaluable baseline or post-baseline data will be censored at Day 1. 8.1.8.3  Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) The BFI (Appendix F 2) is a self-administered instrument developed to assess the severity of fatigue and the impact of fatigue on functioning (Mendoza et al 1999).  It includes 9 items which measure fatigue severity (3 items) and fatigue interference (6 items).  The first 3 items (Item 1, Item 2, and Item 3) ask participants about their: level of fatigue right now, usual level of fatigue within the past 24 hours, and fatigue at its worst level within the past 24 hours on an 11-point NRS of 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine).  The 6 fatigue interference items (Item 4A, Item 4B, Item 4C, Item 4D, Item 4E, and Item 4F, respectively) evaluate participants on the extent to which fatigue interfered with their daily activities (ie, general activity, mood, walking, work, relationships, and enjoyment of life) on an 11-point NRS of 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).  While not developed specifically for prostate cancer or mHSPC, its reliability and clinical and concurrent validity have been demonstrated in cancer more generally (Mendoza et al 1999, Whitehead 2009).  It has also been used to measure fatigue in one mHSPC study (LATITUDE, Fizazi et al 2019) and one mCRPC study (COU-AA-301, Sternberg et al 2013), respectively.  The items\/scales used to measure fatigue in LATITUDE are not specified.  In COU-AA-301, fatigue was measured via \u2018fatigue intensity', defined as the score of the worst fatigue item (Item 3), and \u2018fatigue interference', defined as the average score of all the interference items (Items 4A - 4F).  A clinically important difference in \u2018fatigue intensity' was defined in this study as a change in \u2265 2 points from baseline, while a change in \u2265 1.25 points from baseline for \u2018fatigue interference' was considered clinically meaningful (Sternberg et al 2013).  These clinically important thresholds will be used in the current study. In this study, the \u2018worst fatigue' (Item 3) will be used as a single item in assessing deterioration in \u2018fatigue intensity'.  Also, a composite or mean score of 3 items (Items 1-3) will be evaluated as \u2018fatigue severity'.  Finally, a \u2018fatigue interference' domain score will be based on a mean of the 6 interference items (Items 4A-4F). The following may be derived as secondary endpoints: Time to deterioration in fatigue intensity (defined as a change \u2265 2 points from baseline in worst fatigue item [Item 3] score). Time to deterioration in fatigue interference (defined as a change \u2265 1.25 points from baseline in fatigue interference domain score). Change from baseline in fatigue severity and fatigue interference domain scores. 8.1.8.4  FACT-P The FACT-P (Appendix F 3) is a disease-specific 39-item questionnaire included for the purpose of assessing HRQoL and prostate cancer-specific symptoms.  It is a well-established measure of HRQoL\/health status commonly used in prostate cancer studies.  The FACT-P was developed specifically for patients with advanced prostate cancer and has been found to be reliable and valid in this population (Esper et al 1997).  The FACT-P consists of 5 subscales: Physical Well-Being (PWB; 7 items), Functional Well-Being (FWB; 7 items), Emotional Well-Being (EWB; 6 items), Social Well-Being (SWB; 7 items), and Additional Concerns or Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS) specific to prostate cancer (12 items).  All FACT-P questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4 (0 being not at all and 4 being very much).  Negatively stated items are reversed by subtracting the response from 4.  For all subscales, symptoms index, and individual item scores, the higher the score, the better the HRQoL\/symptom.  In addition to the Total and Subscale scores, the FACT-P also supports the calculation of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) total score (sum of PWB, SWB, EWB, and FWB scores), a Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score (the sum of the PWB, FWB, and PCS scores), and the FACT Advanced Prostate Symptom Index-6 (FAPSI-6), a symptom score made up of 6 items from within the FACT-P (3 pain items, 1 fatigue item, 1 weight loss item, and 1 condition getting worse item). The following may be derived as other secondary endpoints: Time to deterioration in FACT-P scores (FACT-P total score, FACT-G total score, TOI, functional well-being, physical well-being, prostate cancer subscale, and FAPSI-6, respectively). Change from baseline in FACT-P scores (FACT-P total score, FACT-G total score, TOI, functional well-being, physical well-being, prostate cancer subscale, and FAPSI-6, respectively). 8.1.8.5  PRO-CTCAE The PRO-CTCAE (Appendix F 5) will only be administered where a linguistically validated version exists for a country. PRO-CTCAE was developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and is included to address tolerability from the patients' perspective.  PRO-CTCAE is an item library of symptoms experienced by patients while undergoing treatment of their cancer.  It was developed in recognition that collecting treatment-related symptom data directly from patients using PRO tools can improve the accuracy and efficiency of symptomatic AE data collection.  This was based on findings from multiple studies demonstrating that physicians and nurses underestimate symptom onset, frequency, and severity in comparison with patient ratings (Basch et al 2009, Litwin et al 1998, Sprangers and Aaronson 1992).  To date, 78 symptoms of the CTCAE have been identified to be amenable to patient reporting.  These symptoms have been converted to patient terms (eg, CTCAE term \u2018myalgia' converted to \u2018aching muscles').  The items included in the PRO-CTCAE have undergone extensive qualitative review among experts and patients.  Using cognitive testing methods, these items and the additional questions for some of the symptoms have been extensively evaluated by cancer patients, so that symptoms of interest are clear, comprehendible, and measurable.  Not all items are administered in any one clinical study.  The intention is to only ask participants to complete those items considered relevant for the study, site of cancer, and cancer treatment.  Participants on all study arms will complete the same selection of symptom items for the PRO-CTCAE.  Several decision rules were applied to the selection to achieve an unbiased selection and reasonable patient completion time.  Safety data for capivasertib, abiraterone acetate, and hormonal treatments (administered in both arms of the study) informed the symptom selection.  Safety and AE data for capivasertib was accessed via the most recent IB, while the US Package Inserts were used to assess the abiraterone and ADT.  Symptomatic AEs from the PRO-CTCAE items library that are considered relevant based on the reported safety and AEs for capivasertib, abiraterone, and hormonal treatments were selected for this study (see Appendix F 5). The Free Text item in the PRO-CTCAE instrument is not included in this study, as the utility of this information and the analysis method have not been established.  The full list of items is available in Appendix F 5. 8.1.8.6  PGIS The impact of treatment on the overall severity of cancer symptoms over the past week will be assessed using the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) single-item questionnaire (Appendix F 4).  PGIS is useful for determining the responder threshold of other PRO measures. 8.1.8.7  EQ-5D-5L The EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal (EuroQol Group 1990).  Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in population health surveys.  The questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions as follows: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain\/discomfort, and anxiety\/depression.  Each dimension has 5 response options (\u2018no problems', \u2018slight problems', \u2018moderate problems', \u2018severe problems', and \u2018extreme problems') that reflect increasing levels of difficulty (EuroQol Group 2013). Previous versions of EQ-5D had only 3 levels of difficulty, EQ-5D-3L.  Since 2009, the EuroQol Group developed a more sensitive version of the EQ-5D (the EQ-5D-5L) that expands the range of responses to each dimension from 3 to 5 levels of increasing severity (Herdman et al 2011).  Preliminary studies indicate that the 5L version improves upon the properties of the 3L measure in terms of reduced ceiling effect, increased reliability, and an improved ability to differentiate between different levels of health (Janssen et al 2008a, Janssen et al 2008b, Pickard et al 2007).  A sample of the EQ-5D-5L is provided in Appendix F 6. The participant will be asked to indicate their current health state by selecting the most appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensions.  The questionnaire also includes a visual analog scale, where the participant will be asked to rate current health status on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst imaginable health state. 8.1.8.8  Analgesic Log The analgesic log will be implemented using the ERT Medication Module\u2122, a component of the ERT eCOA System that serves for accurately tracking subject consumption of concomitant and\/or rescue medications.  The Medication Module allows medication data capture via the ERT eCOA Universal App, followed by the review and management of that data by sites and sponsors.  The Medication Module provides a consistent, easier-to-use and more efficient tool compared with paper-based reporting.  Using the module, participants will record all analgesic medication dosages and dosage times to track pain medications use.  The Medication Module includes the following components: Global Master Medication List: This list will be developed collaboratively by ERT and AstraZeneca and will contain all approved analgesic drug names including generic names and formulations.  The list will be updated over the course of the study via an approval workflow process, when necessary. eCOA Universal App Medication Diary: The medication diary will allow participants to log analgesic medication intake during scheduled assessments.  Study sites will check and update the medication diary for participants as needed throughout the study. Medication Report: This may be used to remotely update the tailored list of medications available on a participant's eCOA Universal App. The analgesic log is study specific (not generic) and screenshots will be available and submitted along with the CSP to IRB\/IECs. Although information on all analgesics used by participants in pain control will be collected using the analgesic log, only changes in opiate are considered in pain progression evaluation in line with FDA recommendation.  Opiates consumed by participants will be converted into oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) as defined in Chung et al 2014.  The analgesic quantification algorithm (AQA) developed by Chung et al 2014 will be used to quantify and score analgesic use in the study.  The AQA is an 8-point scale that assigns a score as follows: 0 = No analgesic 1 = Non-opioid analgesics 2 = Weak opioids (eg, codeine, tramadol) 3 = Strong opioids \u2264 75 mg OME per day 4 = Strong opioids > 75 to 150 mg OME per day 5 = Strong opioids > 150 to 300 mg OME per day 6 = Strong opioids > 300 to 600 mg OME per day 7 = Strong opioids > 600 mg OME per day 8.1.8.9  Analgesic Use Scoring Opiate analgesic use (AQA score) will be assessed at timelines specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  The average daily OME will require at least 4 days of data and will be used to assign the AQA score.  An increase of 1 point or more in the AQA score from a starting value of 1 or higher OR \u2265 2 points in AQA score from a starting value of 0 is considered a clinically meaningful increase in opiate use.  Similarly, a decrease of 1 point or more in the AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher is considered a clinically meaningful decrease in opiate use. 8.1.8.10  Administration of PRO Questionnaires The PRO instruments will be self-administered at home by the participants using handheld devices at the time points indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Participants may complete the ePROs at study sites if the assessment time point coincides with a scheduled site visit; otherwise, participants may complete the ePROs at home.  The analgesic use log using the ERT Medication Module\u2122 will also be administered electronically alongside the ePROs.  If there is a technical issue with the device, the site will have access to a web-based back up. Each site must allocate the responsibility for the administration of the ePRO instruments to a specific individual (eg, a research nurse or study coordinator) and, if possible, assign a backup person to cover if that individual is absent. Approximately 15 to 30 minutes is required for participants to complete the questionnaires. The below instructions should be followed when collecting PRO data via an electronic device: PRO questionnaires completed at site visits must be completed prior to treatment administration and ideally before any discussions of health status to avoid biasing the participant's responses to the questions.  As feasible, site staff should also ensure PRO questionnaires are completed prior to other study procedures, such as collection of laboratory samples, to further minimise bias. When each instrument is due to be completed, the following order will be observed: BPI-SF, BFI, Analgesic Log, FACT-P, PGIS, EQ-5D-5L, and then PRO-CTCAE. PRO questionnaires should be completed by the participant in a quiet and private location. The participant should be given sufficient time to complete the questionnaires at their own speed. The research nurse or appointed site staff must explain to participants the value and relevance of ePRO participation, so they are motivated to comply with questionnaire completion.  Inform the participant that these questions are being asked to find out, directly from them, how they feel. The research nurse or appointed site staff should stress that the information is not routinely shared with study staff. Therefore, if the participant has any medical problems, they should discuss them with the doctor or research nurse separately from the ePRO assessment. The research nurse or appointed site staff must train the participant on how to use the PRO device, using the materials and training provided by the ePRO vendor. The research nurse or appointed site staff must provide guidance on whom to call if there are problems with the device if the participant is completing the ePRO at home. All questionnaires must be completed using the ePRO device; paper questionnaires are not allowed in this study. The research nurse or appointed site staff must remind participants there are no right or wrong answers and avoid introducing bias by not clarifying items for the participant. The participant should not receive help from relatives, friends, or clinic staff to respond to the ePRO questionnaires.  The responses are the participant's alone. On completion of the questionnaire at the site, the device should be handed back to the designated responsible person, who should check that all questionnaires were completed. If a participant uses visual aids (eg, spectacles or contact lenses) for reading and does not have them when he or she attends the clinic, the participant will be exempted from completing the ePROs at that clinic visit, though they can complete them at home if within the allowable window. Site staff must not read or complete the ePRO questionnaires on behalf of the participant.  If the participant is unable to read the questionnaire (eg, is blind or illiterate), that participant is exempted from completing PRO questionnaires but may still participate in the study.  If the participant cannot complete the ePRO questionnaires due to other than being blind or illiterate, the AstraZeneca study team must be contacted to determine if they can be exempted.  This includes requirements for screening questionnaires.  Participants exempted in this regard should be flagged appropriately by the site staff in the source documents and in the Review of PRO\/Questionnaire\/Diary (REVPRDI) eCRF. Site staff must administer questionnaires available in the language that the participant speaks and understands.  Questions should not be read in an available language and translated into another language for the participant. It is vital that the ePRO reporting is conducted at the Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1 visit, as specified in the SoA.  The participant should bring the device to every site visit so the site can confirm the device is functioning properly.  It is especially critical the participant bring the device to the Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1 visit so not to miss the assessments that have baseline at this visit.  The ePRO device must be charged and fully functional at the beginning of the baseline visit to ensure that the PROs can be completed at the start of the visit. Finally, the research nurse or appointed site staff will review the completion status of questionnaires during site visits and document the reason(s) why a participant could not complete assessments either in the REVPRDI eCRF or the device depending on the set-up for the study. Reminders should be sent to the participant at home as needed to ensure compliance with the assessment schedules.  The research nurse or appointed site staff must monitor compliance, since minimising missing data is a key aspect of study success.  It is important that the PRO device is charged and fully functional.  Compliance must be checked at each study visit and should be checked more frequently to identify problems early.  If compliance drops below 88%, they will be flagged in the routine compliance report generated by the ePRO system, and a check-in call from the study site to ask the participant if he or she has any difficulties is highly recommended.  A solution to enhance\/resolve compliance should be discussed with the participant.  Discussions and compliance review should be reflected in source documents. 8.1.8.11  Unify Mobile Software Application The electronic device containing the PRO instruments will also contain a Unify mobile software application.  The Unify mobile software application, and associated website system, will provide digital support to patients from screening through to, and including, follow-up.  The system will provide patients and site study staff with information and tools relevant to the conduct of the study in accordance with this CSP.  This will comprise treatment medication reminders, clinical visit reminders, and educational content relating to the disease and medication."

          "Section":"8.1.1 Tumour Assessments",
          "Text":"8.1.1  Tumour Assessments Tumour assessments will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and a bone scan for whole body.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before randomisation, and ideally, should be performed as close as possible to randomisation.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) relative to the date of randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), regardless of discontinuation of study treatment (eg, discontinuation due to toxicity or clinical progression) or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy. The assessments by different imaging modalities (eg, CT and bone scintigraphy) can be done on different days but should all be performed within the assessment schedule.  It is important to follow the imaging assessment schedule as closely as possible; however, tumour assessment can be performed at any time when disease progression is clinically suspected.  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged.  If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at the participant's scheduled visits. Participants who discontinue study treatment prior to progression should continue to be scanned until progression.  The same imaging modality and the same assessment (eg, the same contrast protocol for CT scans) should be performed at baseline and at all follow-up time points. Radiological examinations performed during the study should be retained at site as source data."

          "Section":"8.1.2 Evaluation of Disease Progression",
          "Text":"8.1.2  Evaluation of Disease Progression 8.1.2.1  Radiographic PFS Radiographic PFS is defined as the time from randomisation to: 1) radiographic progression, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), or 2) death due to any cause regardless of whether the participant withdraws from randomised treatment or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression. Radiographic PFS will be measured by investigator assessment, and a sensitivity analysis of PFS assessed by BICR will also be conducted (see Section 8.1.2.4). The definitions of measurable, non-measurable, target and non-target lesions for assessment of soft tissue using RECIST 1.1 criteria, methods of assessment, and the objective tumour response criteria are provided in Appendix E 2.  The PCWG3 guidelines are provided in Appendix E 3. Participants who have not progressed, as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) or PCWG3 criteria (bone), or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 assessment.  However, if the participant progresses or dies immediately after 2 or more consecutive missed visits, the participant will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 bone assessment prior to the 2 missed visits. 8.1.2.2  Evaluation of Soft Tissue Lesions The criteria for objective tumour response on soft tissue lesions will be based on RECIST 1.1: CR (complete response), PR (partial response), SD (stable disease), PD (progressive disease), NE (not evaluable), and NED (no evidence of disease). For participants with measurable lesion at baseline, target lesion progression will be calculated in reference to the smallest tumour burden on study (ie, the smallest sum of diameters previously recorded on study).  In the absence of progression, target lesion response will be calculated using as reference the baseline tumour measurements obtained before starting treatment.  For these participants, the objective tumour response assessment options are CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE. For participants with non-measurable soft tissue lesions only at baseline, the objective tumour response assessment options are CR, PD, Non CR\/Non PD, and NE. For participants with bone lesions only and no soft tissue disease at baseline, the objective tumour response assessment options will be NED, PD (if a new soft tissue lesion appears), or NE (if the scan is not performed). If the investigator is in doubt as to whether disease progression has occurred, particularly with regard to non-target lesions or the appearance of a new lesion, it is advisable to continue treatment and reassess the tumour burden at the next scheduled assessment or sooner if clinically indicated.  If repeat scans confirm progression, then the date of the initial scan should be declared as the date of progression.  New bone lesions should not be counted in the RECIST assessment. To achieve \u2018unequivocal progression' on the basis of non-target lesions, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest \u2018increase' in the size of 1 or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. 8.1.2.3  Evaluation of Bone Lesions Progression on a bone scan is identified using PCWG3 criteria, by having 2 or more new metastatic bone lesions.

Results of these independent reviews will not be communicated to investigators, and results of investigator tumour assessments will not be shared with the central reviewers.  The management of participants will be based solely upon the results of the RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and PCWG3 (bone) assessment conducted by the investigator. All treatment decisions will be based on site assessment of scans.  After the primary rPFS analysis, central review of scans will no longer be required, and investigators will be advised when to stop sending copies of the scans to the CRO conducting the central review. 8.1.2.5  PFS2 PFS2 is defined as the time from randomisation until progression on next-line treatment (ie, the line of treatment following the first progression in the study), as clinical progression, PSA progression, or radiographic progression determined by RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone) as assessed by the investigator, or death due to any cause.  Censoring details will be defined in the SAP. A participant will enter the PFS2 follow-up period once that participant has discontinued study treatment due to progressive disease by RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue lesions and\/or PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions. The participant's status at first progression will be used as the reference for assessment of PFS2. RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 assessments will not be collected for assessment of PFS2. The date of PFS2 assessment and the investigator's opinion of progression status (progressed or non-progressed) at each assessment will be recorded in the eCRF.  Determination of progressive disease for PFS2 will be by institutional call."

For participants with measurable lesion at baseline, target lesion progression will be calculated in reference to the smallest tumour burden on study (ie, the smallest sum of diameters previously recorded on study).  In the absence of progression, target lesion response will be calculated using as reference the baseline tumour measurements obtained before starting treatment.  For these participants, the objective tumour response assessment options are CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE. For participants with non-measurable soft tissue lesions only at baseline, the objective tumour response assessment options are CR, PD, Non CR\/Non PD, and NE. For participants with bone lesions only and no soft tissue disease at baseline, the objective tumour response assessment options will be NED, PD (if a new soft tissue lesion appears), or NE (if the scan is not performed). If the investigator is in doubt as to whether disease progression has occurred, particularly with regard to non-target lesions or the appearance of a new lesion, it is advisable to continue treatment and reassess the tumour burden at the next scheduled assessment or sooner if clinically indicated.  If repeat scans confirm progression, then the date of the initial scan should be declared as the date of progression.  New bone lesions should not be counted in the RECIST assessment. To achieve \u2018unequivocal progression' on the basis of non-target lesions, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest \u2018increase' in the size of 1 or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status."

A COA may be used in clinical studies to provide either direct or indirect evidence of treatment benefit.  It is important to examine the impact of therapy on disease-related symptoms, physical function, and other HRQoL of the patient to aid understanding of how clinical benefit relates to patient well-being and for consideration in making risk-benefit evaluations.  PRO is one type of clinical outcome assessment and is a general term referring to all outcomes and symptoms that are directly reported by the patient.  Moreover, PROs assist in the documentation of symptoms and specifically what symptoms and impacts are most important to patients and how these relate to clinical outcomes.  PROs have become important in evaluating effectiveness of study treatments in clinical studies and will aid in understanding of the benefit\/risk evaluation (Kluetz et al 2018).  The following PROs will be administered in this study: BPI-SF, BFI, FACT-P, PGIS, EQ-5D-5L, and selected questions from the PRO-CTCAE items library.  Samples of the PRO questionnaires are provided in Appendix F.  PROs will be administered according to the SoA (Section 1.3).  PROs will be provided in the native language(s) of the country in which they will be administered, except for PRO-CTCAE, which will only be administered in the languages where a linguistically validated version is available. 8.1.8.1  BPI-SF The BPI-SF (Appendix F 1) is a validated, 15-item domain-specific instrument designed to assess the severity of pain and the impact\/interference of pain on daily functions (Cleeland and Ryan 1994).  The BPI-SF will be scored according to the user guide (Cleeland 2009).  All BPI-SF pain items including \u2018worst pain' is scored on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS) with 0 = No Pain and 10 = Worst Pain Imaginable.  This instrument consists of 2 domains: pain severity and pain interference.  The pain severity domain consists of 4 items (Item 3, Item 4, Item 5, and Item 6) which assess pain at its \u2018worst,' \u2018least,' \u2018average,' and \u2018now' (current pain) respectively on the 11-point NRS.  These 4 items may be averaged as a composite pain severity score or they may be interpreted individually (Dworkin et al 2005, Dworkin et al 2008, FDA 2009, Turk et al 2006).  In this study, the \u2018worst pain' (Item 3) will be used as a single item in assessing pain progression.  A composite pain severity score from all the 4 items will also be evaluated.  A 2- or more point change in the \u2018worst pain' item is considered clinically meaningful. The pain interference domain score is a mean of 7 items: general activity (Item 9A), mood (Item 9B), walking ability (Item 9C), normal work (Item 9D), relations with other people (Item 9E), sleep (Item 9F), and enjoyment of life (Item 9G), each scored on an 11-point NRS from 0 (Does not interfere) to 10 (Completely interferes).  Based on the BPI-SF scoring manual, the following items are not used in scoring pain severity or pain interference domains: Items 1, 2, 7, and 8.  Item 7 (a free text field) describing pain medication use is captured separately in more detail using the analgesic log. The BPI-SF analgesic log (captured on ePRO device) will be completed by the participant as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Further details on the analgesic log and scoring are provided in Sections 8.1.8.8 and 8.1.8.9, respectively. Time to pain progression is a key secondary endpoint of this study (see Section 8.1.8.2).  In addition, change from baseline in pain severity and pain interference domain scores may be derived. 8.1.8.2  Time to Pain Progression The key secondary endpoint of TTPP is defined as the time from randomisation to the time point at which clinically meaningful pain progression is observed, based on a 2-point increase from baseline in the BPI-SF Item 3 \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' score and\/or initiation of\/increase in opiate analgesic use.  A minimum of 4 days of data is required.  The criteria for pain progression depend on whether a participant is asymptomatic or symptomatic at baseline: Asymptomatic participants at baseline (average BPI-SF Item 3 score of 0 and not taking opioids) Increase of 2 or more points in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' (BPI-SF Item 3) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks) OR Initiation of opioid use for pain Symptomatic participants at baseline (average BPI-SF Item 3 score > 0 and\/or currently taking opioids) Increase of 2 or more points in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' (BPI-SF Item 3) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks) and an average worst pain score \u2265 4, and no decrease in average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or more points decrease in AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher OR Increase in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or more points increase (or at least 2 points increase if the starting value is 0) in the AQA score from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks). Participants satisfying one or more of the criteria above will be considered to have pain progression.  Participants who do not satisfy any of the criteria above will be censored at the time of the last known assessment that showed an absence of pain progression. Censoring A number of situations will lead to a participant's time to pain progression being censored; these are as follows: If a participant meets the criteria for pain progression after 2 or more missed visits (visits which showed < 4 days of BPI-SF worst pain [Item 3] assessments and the average AQA score does not meet the progression criteria), then the participant will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used). Participants who have not met the criteria for pain progression at the time of analysis: The censoring date will be the date of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used). Participants with no evaluable baseline or post-baseline data will be censored at Day 1. For participants who receive subsequent anticancer therapy: The censoring date will be the date of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment prior to the start date of subsequent anticancer therapy (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used) Participants with no evaluable baseline or post-baseline data will be censored at Day 1. 8.1.8.3  Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) The BFI (Appendix F 2) is a self-administered instrument developed to assess the severity of fatigue and the impact of fatigue on functioning (Mendoza et al 1999).  It includes 9 items which measure fatigue severity (3 items) and fatigue interference (6 items).  The first 3 items (Item 1, Item 2, and Item 3) ask participants about their: level of fatigue right now, usual level of fatigue within the past 24 hours, and fatigue at its worst level within the past 24 hours on an 11-point NRS of 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine).  The 6 fatigue interference items (Item 4A, Item 4B, Item 4C, Item 4D, Item 4E, and Item 4F, respectively) evaluate participants on the extent to which fatigue interfered with their daily activities (ie, general activity, mood, walking, work, relationships, and enjoyment of life) on an 11-point NRS of 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).  While not developed specifically for prostate cancer or mHSPC, its reliability and clinical and concurrent validity have been demonstrated in cancer more generally (Mendoza et al 1999, Whitehead 2009).  It has also been used to measure fatigue in one mHSPC study (LATITUDE, Fizazi et al 2019) and one mCRPC study (COU-AA-301, Sternberg et al 2013), respectively.  The items\/scales used to measure fatigue in LATITUDE are not specified.  In COU-AA-301, fatigue was measured via \u2018fatigue intensity', defined as the score of the worst fatigue item (Item 3), and \u2018fatigue interference', defined as the average score of all the interference items (Items 4A - 4F).  A clinically important difference in \u2018fatigue intensity' was defined in this study as a change in \u2265 2 points from baseline, while a change in \u2265 1.25 points from baseline for \u2018fatigue interference' was considered clinically meaningful (Sternberg et al 2013).  These clinically important thresholds will be used in the current study. In this study, the \u2018worst fatigue' (Item 3) will be used as a single item in assessing deterioration in \u2018fatigue intensity'.  Also, a composite or mean score of 3 items (Items 1-3) will be evaluated as \u2018fatigue severity'.  Finally, a \u2018fatigue interference' domain score will be based on a mean of the 6 interference items (Items 4A-4F). The following may be derived as secondary endpoints: Time to deterioration in fatigue intensity (defined as a change \u2265 2 points from baseline in worst fatigue item [Item 3] score). Time to deterioration in fatigue interference (defined as a change \u2265 1.25 points from baseline in fatigue interference domain score). Change from baseline in fatigue severity and fatigue interference domain scores. 8.1.8.4  FACT-P The FACT-P (Appendix F 3) is a disease-specific 39-item questionnaire included for the purpose of assessing HRQoL and prostate cancer-specific symptoms.  It is a well-established measure of HRQoL\/health status commonly used in prostate cancer studies.  The FACT-P was developed specifically for patients with advanced prostate cancer and has been found to be reliable and valid in this population (Esper et al 1997).  The FACT-P consists of 5 subscales: Physical Well-Being (PWB; 7 items), Functional Well-Being (FWB; 7 items), Emotional Well-Being (EWB; 6 items), Social Well-Being (SWB; 7 items), and Additional Concerns or Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS) specific to prostate cancer (12 items).  All FACT-P questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4 (0 being not at all and 4 being very much).  Negatively stated items are reversed by subtracting the response from 4.  For all subscales, symptoms index, and individual item scores, the higher the score, the better the HRQoL\/symptom.  In addition to the Total and Subscale scores, the FACT-P also supports the calculation of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) total score (sum of PWB, SWB, EWB, and FWB scores), a Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score (the sum of the PWB, FWB, and PCS scores), and the FACT Advanced Prostate Symptom Index-6 (FAPSI-6), a symptom score made up of 6 items from within the FACT-P (3 pain items, 1 fatigue item, 1 weight loss item, and 1 condition getting worse item). The following may be derived as other secondary endpoints: Time to deterioration in FACT-P scores (FACT-P total score, FACT-G total score, TOI, functional well-being, physical well-being, prostate cancer subscale, and FAPSI-6, respectively). Change from baseline in FACT-P scores (FACT-P total score, FACT-G total score, TOI, functional well-being, physical well-being, prostate cancer subscale, and FAPSI-6, respectively). 8.1.8.5  PRO-CTCAE The PRO-CTCAE (Appendix F 5) will only be administered where a linguistically validated version exists for a country. PRO-CTCAE was developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and is included to address tolerability from the patients' perspective.  PRO-CTCAE is an item library of symptoms experienced by patients while undergoing treatment of their cancer.  It was developed in recognition that collecting treatment-related symptom data directly from patients using PRO tools can improve the accuracy and efficiency of symptomatic AE data collection.  This was based on findings from multiple studies demonstrating that physicians and nurses underestimate symptom onset, frequency, and severity in comparison with patient ratings (Basch et al 2009, Litwin et al 1998, Sprangers and Aaronson 1992).  To date, 78 symptoms of the CTCAE have been identified to be amenable to patient reporting.  These symptoms have been converted to patient terms (eg, CTCAE term \u2018myalgia' converted to \u2018aching muscles').  The items included in the PRO-CTCAE have undergone extensive qualitative review among experts and patients.  Using cognitive testing methods, these items and the additional questions for some of the symptoms have been extensively evaluated by cancer patients, so that symptoms of interest are clear, comprehendible, and measurable.  Not all items are administered in any one clinical study.  The intention is to only ask participants to complete those items considered relevant for the study, site of cancer, and cancer treatment.  Participants on all study arms will complete the same selection of symptom items for the PRO-CTCAE.  Several decision rules were applied to the selection to achieve an unbiased selection and reasonable patient completion time.  Safety data for capivasertib, abiraterone acetate, and hormonal treatments (administered in both arms of the study) informed the symptom selection.  Safety and AE data for capivasertib was accessed via the most recent IB, while the US Package Inserts were used to assess the abiraterone and ADT.  Symptomatic AEs from the PRO-CTCAE items library that are considered relevant based on the reported safety and AEs for capivasertib, abiraterone, and hormonal treatments were selected for this study (see Appendix F 5). The Free Text item in the PRO-CTCAE instrument is not included in this study, as the utility of this information and the analysis method have not been established.  The full list of items is available in Appendix F 5. 8.1.8.6  PGIS The impact of treatment on the overall severity of cancer symptoms over the past week will be assessed using the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) single-item questionnaire (Appendix F 4).  PGIS is useful for determining the responder threshold of other PRO measures. 8.1.8.7  EQ-5D-5L The EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal (EuroQol Group 1990).  Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in population health surveys.  The questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions as follows: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain\/discomfort, and anxiety\/depression.  Each dimension has 5 response options (\u2018no problems', \u2018slight problems', \u2018moderate problems', \u2018severe problems', and \u2018extreme problems') that reflect increasing levels of difficulty (EuroQol Group 2013). Previous versions of EQ-5D had only 3 levels of difficulty, EQ-5D-3L.  Since 2009, the EuroQol Group developed a more sensitive version of the EQ-5D (the EQ-5D-5L) that expands the range of responses to each dimension from 3 to 5 levels of increasing severity (Herdman et al 2011).  Preliminary studies indicate that the 5L version improves upon the properties of the 3L measure in terms of reduced ceiling effect, increased reliability, and an improved ability to differentiate between different levels of health (Janssen et al 2008a, Janssen et al 2008b, Pickard et al 2007).  A sample of the EQ-5D-5L is provided in Appendix F 6. The participant will be asked to indicate their current health state by selecting the most appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensions.  The questionnaire also includes a visual analog scale, where the participant will be asked to rate current health status on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst imaginable health state. 8.1.8.8  Analgesic Log The analgesic log will be implemented using the ERT Medication Module\u2122, a component of the ERT eCOA System that serves for accurately tracking subject consumption of concomitant and\/or rescue medications.  The Medication Module allows medication data capture via the ERT eCOA Universal App, followed by the review and management of that data by sites and sponsors.  The Medication Module provides a consistent, easier-to-use and more efficient tool compared with paper-based reporting.  Using the module, participants will record all analgesic medication dosages and dosage times to track pain medications use.  The Medication Module includes the following components: Global Master Medication List: This list will be developed collaboratively by ERT and AstraZeneca and will contain all approved analgesic drug names including generic names and formulations.  The list will be updated over the course of the study via an approval workflow process, when necessary. eCOA Universal App Medication Diary: The medication diary will allow participants to log analgesic medication intake during scheduled assessments.  Study sites will check and update the medication diary for participants as needed throughout the study. Medication Report: This may be used to remotely update the tailored list of medications available on a participant's eCOA Universal App. The analgesic log is study specific (not generic) and screenshots will be available and submitted along with the CSP to IRB\/IECs. Although information on all analgesics used by participants in pain control will be collected using the analgesic log, only changes in opiate are considered in pain progression evaluation in line with FDA recommendation.  Opiates consumed by participants will be converted into oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) as defined in Chung et al 2014.  The analgesic quantification algorithm (AQA) developed by Chung et al 2014 will be used to quantify and score analgesic use in the study.  The AQA is an 8-point scale that assigns a score as follows: 0 = No analgesic 1 = Non-opioid analgesics 2 = Weak opioids (eg, codeine, tramadol) 3 = Strong opioids \u2264 75 mg OME per day 4 = Strong opioids > 75 to 150 mg OME per day 5 = Strong opioids > 150 to 300 mg OME per day 6 = Strong opioids > 300 to 600 mg OME per day 7 = Strong opioids > 600 mg OME per day 8.1.8.9  Analgesic Use Scoring Opiate analgesic use (AQA score) will be assessed at timelines specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  The average daily OME will require at least 4 days of data and will be used to assign the AQA score.  An increase of 1 point or more in the AQA score from a starting value of 1 or higher OR \u2265 2 points in AQA score from a starting value of 0 is considered a clinically meaningful increase in opiate use.  Similarly, a decrease of 1 point or more in the AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher is considered a clinically meaningful decrease in opiate use. 8.1.8.10  Administration of PRO Questionnaires The PRO instruments will be self-administered at home by the participants using handheld devices at the time points indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Participants may complete the ePROs at study sites if the assessment time point coincides with a scheduled site visit; otherwise, participants may complete the ePROs at home.  The analgesic use log using the ERT Medication Module\u2122 will also be administered electronically alongside the ePROs.  If there is a technical issue with the device, the site will have access to a web-based back up. Each site must allocate the responsibility for the administration of the ePRO instruments to a specific individual (eg, a research nurse or study coordinator) and, if possible, assign a backup person to cover if that individual is absent. Approximately 15 to 30 minutes is required for participants to complete the questionnaires. The below instructions should be followed when collecting PRO data via an electronic device: PRO questionnaires completed at site visits must be completed prior to treatment administration and ideally before any discussions of health status to avoid biasing the participant's responses to the questions.  As feasible, site staff should also ensure PRO questionnaires are completed prior to other study procedures, such as collection of laboratory samples, to further minimise bias. When each instrument is due to be completed, the following order will be observed: BPI-SF, BFI, Analgesic Log, FACT-P, PGIS, EQ-5D-5L, and then PRO-CTCAE. PRO questionnaires should be completed by the participant in a quiet and private location. The participant should be given sufficient time to complete the questionnaires at their own speed. The research nurse or appointed site staff must explain to participants the value and relevance of ePRO participation, so they are motivated to comply with questionnaire completion.  Inform the participant that these questions are being asked to find out, directly from them, how they feel. The research nurse or appointed site staff should stress that the information is not routinely shared with study staff. Therefore, if the participant has any medical problems, they should discuss them with the doctor or research nurse separately from the ePRO assessment. The research nurse or appointed site staff must train the participant on how to use the PRO device, using the materials and training provided by the ePRO vendor. The research nurse or appointed site staff must provide guidance on whom to call if there are problems with the device if the participant is completing the ePRO at home. All questionnaires must be completed using the ePRO device; paper questionnaires are not allowed in this study. The research nurse or appointed site staff must remind participants there are no right or wrong answers and avoid introducing bias by not clarifying items for the participant. The participant should not receive help from relatives, friends, or clinic staff to respond to the ePRO questionnaires.  The responses are the participant's alone. On completion of the questionnaire at the site, the device should be handed back to the designated responsible person, who should check that all questionnaires were completed. If a participant uses visual aids (eg, spectacles or contact lenses) for reading and does not have them when he or she attends the clinic, the participant will be exempted from completing the ePROs at that clinic visit, though they can complete them at home if within the allowable window. Site staff must not read or complete the ePRO questionnaires on behalf of the participant.  If the participant is unable to read the questionnaire (eg, is blind or illiterate), that participant is exempted from completing PRO questionnaires but may still participate in the study.  If the participant cannot complete the ePRO questionnaires due to other than being blind or illiterate, the AstraZeneca study team must be contacted to determine if they can be exempted.  This includes requirements for screening questionnaires.  Participants exempted in this regard should be flagged appropriately by the site staff in the source documents and in the Review of PRO\/Questionnaire\/Diary (REVPRDI) eCRF. Site staff must administer questionnaires available in the language that the participant speaks and understands.  Questions should not be read in an available language and translated into another language for the participant. It is vital that the ePRO reporting is conducted at the Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1 visit, as specified in the SoA.  The participant should bring the device to every site visit so the site can confirm the device is functioning properly.  It is especially critical the participant bring the device to the Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1 visit so not to miss the assessments that have baseline at this visit.  The ePRO device must be charged and fully functional at the beginning of the baseline visit to ensure that the PROs can be completed at the start of the visit. Finally, the research nurse or appointed site staff will review the completion status of questionnaires during site visits and document the reason(s) why a participant could not complete assessments either in the REVPRDI eCRF or the device depending on the set-up for the study. Reminders should be sent to the participant at home as needed to ensure compliance with the assessment schedules.  The research nurse or appointed site staff must monitor compliance, since minimising missing data is a key aspect of study success.  It is important that the PRO device is charged and fully functional.  Compliance must be checked at each study visit and should be checked more frequently to identify problems early.  If compliance drops below 88%, they will be flagged in the routine compliance report generated by the ePRO system, and a check-in call from the study site to ask the participant if he or she has any difficulties is highly recommended.  A solution to enhance\/resolve compliance should be discussed with the participant.  Discussions and compliance review should be reflected in source documents. 8.1.8.11  Unify Mobile Software Application The electronic device containing the PRO instruments will also contain a Unify mobile software application.  The Unify mobile software application, and associated website system, will provide digital support to patients from screening through to, and including, follow-up.  The system will provide patients and site study staff with information and tools relevant to the conduct of the study in accordance with this CSP.  This will comprise treatment medication reminders, clinical visit reminders, and educational content relating to the disease and medication."

          "Text":"8.1.8.1  BPI-SF The BPI-SF (Appendix F 1) is a validated, 15-item domain-specific instrument designed to assess the severity of pain and the impact\/interference of pain on daily functions (Cleeland and Ryan 1994).  The BPI-SF will be scored according to the user guide (Cleeland 2009).  All BPI-SF pain items including \u2018worst pain' is scored on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS) with 0 = No Pain and 10 = Worst Pain Imaginable.  This instrument consists of 2 domains: pain severity and pain interference.  The pain severity domain consists of 4 items (Item 3, Item 4, Item 5, and Item 6) which assess pain at its \u2018worst,' \u2018least,' \u2018average,' and \u2018now' (current pain) respectively on the 11-point NRS.  These 4 items may be averaged as a composite pain severity score or they may be interpreted individually (Dworkin et al 2005, Dworkin et al 2008, FDA 2009, Turk et al 2006).  In this study, the \u2018worst pain' (Item 3) will be used as a single item in assessing pain progression.  A composite pain severity score from all the 4 items will also be evaluated.  A 2- or more point change in the \u2018worst pain' item is considered clinically meaningful. The pain interference domain score is a mean of 7 items: general activity (Item 9A), mood (Item 9B), walking ability (Item 9C), normal work (Item 9D), relations with other people (Item 9E), sleep (Item 9F), and enjoyment of life (Item 9G), each scored on an 11-point NRS from 0 (Does not interfere) to 10 (Completely interferes).  Based on the BPI-SF scoring manual, the following items are not used in scoring pain severity or pain interference domains: Items 1, 2, 7, and 8.  Item 7 (a free text field) describing pain medication use is captured separately in more detail using the analgesic log. The BPI-SF analgesic log (captured on ePRO device) will be completed by the participant as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Further details on the analgesic log and scoring are provided in Sections 8.1.8.8 and 8.1.8.9, respectively. Time to pain progression is a key secondary endpoint of this study (see Section 8.1.8.2).  In addition, change from baseline in pain severity and pain interference domain scores may be derived."

A minimum of 4 days of data is required.  The criteria for pain progression depend on whether a participant is asymptomatic or symptomatic at baseline: Asymptomatic participants at baseline (average BPI-SF Item 3 score of 0 and not taking opioids) Increase of 2 or more points in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' (BPI-SF Item 3) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks) OR Initiation of opioid use for pain Symptomatic participants at baseline (average BPI-SF Item 3 score > 0 and\/or currently taking opioids) Increase of 2 or more points in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' (BPI-SF Item 3) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks) and an average worst pain score \u2265 4, and no decrease in average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or more points decrease in AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher OR Increase in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or more points increase (or at least 2 points increase if the starting value is 0) in the AQA score from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks). Participants satisfying one or more of the criteria above will be considered to have pain progression.  Participants who do not satisfy any of the criteria above will be censored at the time of the last known assessment that showed an absence of pain progression. Censoring A number of situations will lead to a participant's time to pain progression being censored; these are as follows: If a participant meets the criteria for pain progression after 2 or more missed visits (visits which showed < 4 days of BPI-SF worst pain [Item 3] assessments and the average AQA score does not meet the progression criteria), then the participant will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used). Participants who have not met the criteria for pain progression at the time of analysis: The censoring date will be the date of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used). Participants with no evaluable baseline or post-baseline data will be censored at Day 1. For participants who receive subsequent anticancer therapy: The censoring date will be the date of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment prior to the start date of subsequent anticancer therapy (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used) Participants with no evaluable baseline or post-baseline data will be censored at Day 1."

          "Text":"8.1.8.3  Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) The BFI (Appendix F 2) is a self-administered instrument developed to assess the severity of fatigue and the impact of fatigue on functioning (Mendoza et al 1999).  It includes 9 items which measure fatigue severity (3 items) and fatigue interference (6 items).  The first 3 items (Item 1, Item 2, and Item 3) ask participants about their: level of fatigue right now, usual level of fatigue within the past 24 hours, and fatigue at its worst level within the past 24 hours on an 11-point NRS of 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine).  The 6 fatigue interference items (Item 4A, Item 4B, Item 4C, Item 4D, Item 4E, and Item 4F, respectively) evaluate participants on the extent to which fatigue interfered with their daily activities (ie, general activity, mood, walking, work, relationships, and enjoyment of life) on an 11-point NRS of 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).  While not developed specifically for prostate cancer or mHSPC, its reliability and clinical and concurrent validity have been demonstrated in cancer more generally (Mendoza et al 1999, Whitehead 2009).  It has also been used to measure fatigue in one mHSPC study (LATITUDE, Fizazi et al 2019) and one mCRPC study (COU-AA-301, Sternberg et al 2013), respectively.  The items\/scales used to measure fatigue in LATITUDE are not specified.  In COU-AA-301, fatigue was measured via \u2018fatigue intensity', defined as the score of the worst fatigue item (Item 3), and \u2018fatigue interference', defined as the average score of all the interference items (Items 4A - 4F).  A clinically important difference in \u2018fatigue intensity' was defined in this study as a change in \u2265 2 points from baseline, while a change in \u2265 1.25 points from baseline for \u2018fatigue interference' was considered clinically meaningful (Sternberg et al 2013).  These clinically important thresholds will be used in the current study. In this study, the \u2018worst fatigue' (Item 3) will be used as a single item in assessing deterioration in \u2018fatigue intensity'.  Also, a composite or mean score of 3 items (Items 1-3) will be evaluated as \u2018fatigue severity'.  Finally, a \u2018fatigue interference' domain score will be based on a mean of the 6 interference items (Items 4A-4F). The following may be derived as secondary endpoints: Time to deterioration in fatigue intensity (defined as a change \u2265 2 points from baseline in worst fatigue item [Item 3] score). Time to deterioration in fatigue interference (defined as a change \u2265 1.25 points from baseline in fatigue interference domain score).

It is a well-established measure of HRQoL\/health status commonly used in prostate cancer studies.  The FACT-P was developed specifically for patients with advanced prostate cancer and has been found to be reliable and valid in this population (Esper et al 1997).  The FACT-P consists of 5 subscales: Physical Well-Being (PWB; 7 items), Functional Well-Being (FWB; 7 items), Emotional Well-Being (EWB; 6 items), Social Well-Being (SWB; 7 items), and Additional Concerns or Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS) specific to prostate cancer (12 items).  All FACT-P questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4 (0 being not at all and 4 being very much).  Negatively stated items are reversed by subtracting the response from 4.  For all subscales, symptoms index, and individual item scores, the higher the score, the better the HRQoL\/symptom.  In addition to the Total and Subscale scores, the FACT-P also supports the calculation of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) total score (sum of PWB, SWB, EWB, and FWB scores), a Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score (the sum of the PWB, FWB, and PCS scores), and the FACT Advanced Prostate Symptom Index-6 (FAPSI-6), a symptom score made up of 6 items from within the FACT-P (3 pain items, 1 fatigue item, 1 weight loss item, and 1 condition getting worse item).

PRO-CTCAE was developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and is included to address tolerability from the patients' perspective.  PRO-CTCAE is an item library of symptoms experienced by patients while undergoing treatment of their cancer.  It was developed in recognition that collecting treatment-related symptom data directly from patients using PRO tools can improve the accuracy and efficiency of symptomatic AE data collection.  This was based on findings from multiple studies demonstrating that physicians and nurses underestimate symptom onset, frequency, and severity in comparison with patient ratings (Basch et al 2009, Litwin et al 1998, Sprangers and Aaronson 1992).  To date, 78 symptoms of the CTCAE have been identified to be amenable to patient reporting.  These symptoms have been converted to patient terms (eg, CTCAE term \u2018myalgia' converted to \u2018aching muscles').  The items included in the PRO-CTCAE have undergone extensive qualitative review among experts and patients.  Using cognitive testing methods, these items and the additional questions for some of the symptoms have been extensively evaluated by cancer patients, so that symptoms of interest are clear, comprehendible, and measurable.  Not all items are administered in any one clinical study.  The intention is to only ask participants to complete those items considered relevant for the study, site of cancer, and cancer treatment.  Participants on all study arms will complete the same selection of symptom items for the PRO-CTCAE.  Several decision rules were applied to the selection to achieve an unbiased selection and reasonable patient completion time.  Safety data for capivasertib, abiraterone acetate, and hormonal treatments (administered in both arms of the study) informed the symptom selection.  Safety and AE data for capivasertib was accessed via the most recent IB, while the US Package Inserts were used to assess the abiraterone and ADT.  Symptomatic AEs from the PRO-CTCAE items library that are considered relevant based on the reported safety and AEs for capivasertib, abiraterone, and hormonal treatments were selected for this study (see Appendix F 5). The Free Text item in the PRO-CTCAE instrument is not included in this study, as the utility of this information and the analysis method have not been established.

Inform the participant that these questions are being asked to find out, directly from them, how they feel. The research nurse or appointed site staff should stress that the information is not routinely shared with study staff. Therefore, if the participant has any medical problems, they should discuss them with the doctor or research nurse separately from the ePRO assessment. The research nurse or appointed site staff must train the participant on how to use the PRO device, using the materials and training provided by the ePRO vendor. The research nurse or appointed site staff must provide guidance on whom to call if there are problems with the device if the participant is completing the ePRO at home. All questionnaires must be completed using the ePRO device; paper questionnaires are not allowed in this study. The research nurse or appointed site staff must remind participants there are no right or wrong answers and avoid introducing bias by not clarifying items for the participant. The participant should not receive help from relatives, friends, or clinic staff to respond to the ePRO questionnaires.  The responses are the participant's alone. On completion of the questionnaire at the site, the device should be handed back to the designated responsible person, who should check that all questionnaires were completed. If a participant uses visual aids (eg, spectacles or contact lenses) for reading and does not have them when he or she attends the clinic, the participant will be exempted from completing the ePROs at that clinic visit, though they can complete them at home if within the allowable window. Site staff must not read or complete the ePRO questionnaires on behalf of the participant.  If the participant is unable to read the questionnaire (eg, is blind or illiterate), that participant is exempted from completing PRO questionnaires but may still participate in the study.  If the participant cannot complete the ePRO questionnaires due to other than being blind or illiterate, the AstraZeneca study team must be contacted to determine if they can be exempted.  This includes requirements for screening questionnaires.  Participants exempted in this regard should be flagged appropriately by the site staff in the source documents and in the Review of PRO\/Questionnaire\/Diary (REVPRDI) eCRF. Site staff must administer questionnaires available in the language that the participant speaks and understands.  Questions should not be read in an available language and translated into another language for the participant. It is vital that the ePRO reporting is conducted at the Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1 visit, as specified in the SoA.  The participant should bring the device to every site visit so the site can confirm the device is functioning properly.  It is especially critical the participant bring the device to the Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1 visit so not to miss the assessments that have baseline at this visit.  The ePRO device must be charged and fully functional at the beginning of the baseline visit to ensure that the PROs can be completed at the start of the visit. Finally, the research nurse or appointed site staff will review the completion status of questionnaires during site visits and document the reason(s) why a participant could not complete assessments either in the REVPRDI eCRF or the device depending on the set-up for the study. Reminders should be sent to the participant at home as needed to ensure compliance with the assessment schedules.  The research nurse or appointed site staff must monitor compliance, since minimising missing data is a key aspect of study success.  It is important that the PRO device is charged and fully functional.  Compliance must be checked at each study visit and should be checked more frequently to identify problems early.  If compliance drops below 88%, they will be flagged in the routine compliance report generated by the ePRO system, and a check-in call from the study site to ask the participant if he or she has any difficulties is highly recommended.  A solution to enhance\/resolve compliance should be discussed with the participant.  Discussions and compliance review should be reflected in source documents."

          "Text":"8.2  Safety Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Section 1.3). 8.2.1  Physical Examinations The physical examination will be performed at timelines as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3) and will include an assessment of the following: general appearance, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdomen skin, head and neck (including ears, eyes, nose and throat), lymph nodes, thyroid, musculoskeletal (including spine and extremities) and neurological systems. Weight and height will be assessed at timelines as specified in the SoA. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses, new or worsening abnormalities may qualify as AEs. 8.2.2  Vital Signs Vital signs (including blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature) will be assessed at timelines as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed with a completely automated device.  Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones). Vital signs will be measured in a supine position after 10 minutes rest and will include temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse.  Three readings of blood pressure and pulse will be taken and should be reported in the participant's notes.  The first reading should be rejected.  The second and third readings should be averaged to give the measurement to be recorded in the eCRF. 8.2.3  Electrocardiograms Triplicate 12-lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (Section 1.3). All ECGs to be conducted as triplicate measurements, within approximately 5 minutes of starting (the 3 ECGs separated by approximately 2 minutes).  Assessments should be performed as close as possible to, but within 30 minutes of the nominal time point. The timing and number of ECGs may be altered depending on the emerging PK and safety profile.  Additional ECGs may be taken at the discretion of the investigator. Twelve-lead ECGs will be obtained after the participant has been resting semi-supine for at least 10 minutes prior to the times indicated.  All ECGs should be recorded with the participant in the same physical position.  A standardised ECG machine should be used and the participant should be examined using the same machine throughout the study if possible. After paper ECGs have been recorded, the investigator or designated physician will review each of the ECGs and may refer to a local cardiologist if appropriate.  A paper copy should be filed in the participant's medical records. If an abnormal ECG finding at screening or baseline is considered clinically significant by the investigator, it should be reported as a concurrent condition.  For all ECGs, details of intervals PR, R-R, QRS, QT, and QTcF and an overall evaluation will be recorded (normal; abnormal, non-clinically significant or abnormal, clinically significant). 8.2.4  Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis will be taken at the visits indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3). Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator.  The date, time of collection and results (values, units, and reference ranges) will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. The clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis will be performed at a local laboratory at or near to the investigator site.  Sample tubes and sample sizes may vary depending on laboratory method used and routine practice at the site. Laboratory values that meet the criteria for CTCAE grade 3 or have changed significantly from baseline and are considered to be of clinical concern will be repeated\/confirmed within 7 days and followed up as appropriate. The investigator should assess the available results with regard to clinically relevant abnormalities.  The laboratory results should be signed and dated and retained at centre as source data for laboratory variables.  For information on how AEs based on laboratory tests should be recorded and reported, see Section 8.3.6. Table 7 lists the clinical safety laboratory variables to be measured.

On blood glucose assessment days (incorporating clinical chemistry and glucose) it is requested that participants refrain from caloric intake for \u2265 4 hours prior to the morning dose of study treatment. Glucose (fasting) is to be measured at screening, pre-dose; at 1 hour and 4 hours post-dose in Cycle 1, Day 1; pre-dose on Cycle 1, Day 15; pre-dose in Cycle 2, Day 1; and at discontinuation of study treatment. Further glucose monitoring may be performed at the investigator's discretion in Cycles 1 and 2 based on the participant's characteristics (ie, diabetes or high risk of hyperglycaemia), and in Cycle 3 onwards based on results during Cycles 1 and 2. HbA1c is to be measured at screening, every 16 weeks from Cycle 1, Day 1, and at discontinuation of study treatment. Note: in addition to the fasted glucose assessments identified in the SoA (Section 1.3), random glucose measurements are to be performed (and recorded) as part of the standard clinical chemistry assessments throughout the study. 8.2.4.2  Serum Creatinine After Cycle 2 onwards, participants taking capivasertib\/placebo and metformin in combination should have creatinine assessments conducted as part of the routine clinical chemistry with additional monitoring of creatinine at the discretion of the investigator. 8.2.5  MUGA Scan\/Echocardiogram Assessments will be performed at screening and thereafter as clinically indicated.  Bidimensional echocardiography (Echo) is the preferred modality because of the global technetium [Tc-99m] shortage (but MUGA can be used alternatively). The modality of the cardiac function assessments must be consistent within participant, ie, if echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment and a follow-up assessment if clinically indicated, then echocardiogram should also be used for subsequent scans if required.  The participant should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible."

          "Text":"8.3  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The Principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix H. AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorised representative). The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE.  For information on how to follow up AEs see Section 8.3.2. 8.3.1  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information Adverse events, including SAEs, will be collected from time of signature of the ICF, throughout the treatment period and including the 30-day follow-up period after discontinuation of study drug.  * *In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs\/SAEs must be reported. If the investigator becomes aware of a SAE with a suspected causal relationship to the IMP that occurs after the end of the clinical study in a participant treated by him or her, the investigator shall, without undue delay, report the SAE to the sponsor. 8.3.2  Follow-up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE\/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits\/contacts.  All SAEs\/non-serious AEs (as defined in Appendix H), will be followed until resolution, stabilisation, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up. A post-study assessment will be performed preferably within 7 days of the time that the IMP is permanently discontinued. Safety follow-up should be carried out with the participant 30 days (+ 7 days) after the discontinuation of study treatment to follow-up any SAEs\/AEs and concomitant medications (including any subsequent cancer therapy). Any AE\/SAE\/abnormal laboratory findings that are ongoing at the time of study treatment discontinuation or any new treatment related events within 30 days of study treatment, must be followed up to resolution or until the event becomes stable (or returns to baseline) or is unlikely to resolve further in the opinion of the investigator. Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant's last AE assessment or other assessment\/visit as appropriate in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF.  AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any participant with ongoing AE(s)\/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 8.3.3  Adverse Event Variables The following variables will be collected for each AE: AE (verbatim) The date when the AE started and stopped CTCAE grade and changes in CTCAE grade Whether the AE is serious or not Investigator causality rating against the IMP(s) (yes or no) Action taken with regard to IMP(s) AE caused participant's withdrawal from study (yes or no) Outcome. In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: Date AE met criteria for serious AE Date investigator became aware of SAE AE is serious due to Date of hospitalisation Date of discharge Probable cause of death Date of death Autopsy performed Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) Causality assessment to other medication 8.3.4  Causality Collection The investigator should assess the causal relationship between the IMP and each AE, and answer \u2018yes' or \u2018no' to the question \u2018Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?' For SAEs, causal relationship should also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as \u2018yes'. A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix H. 8.3.5  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the participant or reported in response to the open question from the study site staff (eg, \u2018Have you had any health problems since the previous visit\/you were last asked?'), or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF.  When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 8.3.6  Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests The results from the CSP-mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG abnormalities should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria, are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product or are considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the investigator (which may include but not limited to consideration as to whether treatment or non-planned visits were required or other action was taken with the study treatment, eg, dose adjustment or drug interruption). If deterioration in a laboratory value\/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result\/vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE\/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally related to the disease under study (see Section 8.3.8). 8.3.7  Hy's Law Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT \u2265 3xULN together with total bilirubin \u2265 2xULN may need to be reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix G for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy's Law. 8.3.8  Disease Progression Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a participant's condition attributable to the disease for which the investigational product is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and\/or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The development of new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events that are unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an AE during the study. 8.3.9  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational product, or to the study procedure(s)*.  All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. *In Screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting). If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately.  investigators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the EDC system, an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the EDC system is not available, then the investigator or other study site staff reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the investigator\/study site staff how to proceed. For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix H. The reference document for definition of expectedness\/listedness for capivasertib is the current IB; for abiraterone, the local prescribing information is the reference document for definition of expectedness\/listedness. 8.3.10  Pregnancy Paternal Exposure Participants should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 16 weeks following the last dose of capivasertib\/placebo. Pregnancy of the participants' partners is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until 16 weeks after the last dose should, if possible, be followed up and documented. 8.3.11  Medication Error If a medication error occurs in the course of the study, then the investigator or other site personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is completed within 1 (Initial Fatal\/Life-Threatening or follow up Fatal\/Life-Threatening) or 5 (other serious initial and follow up) calendar days if there is an SAE associated with the medication error (see Section 8.3.9) and within 30 days for all other medication errors. The definition of a Medication Error can be found in Appendix H 4. 8.3.12  Management of Capivasertib-related Toxicities 8.3.12.1  Capivasertib\/Placebo Dose Modification and Guidance Please refer to Section 6.6 for guidance on dose modifications. 8.3.12.2  Dose Modifications due to General Capivasertib-related Toxicities Treatment with capivasertib\/placebo should be temporarily interrupted for any intolerable AE regardless of grade or for any AEs grade \u2265 3 that occurs despite optimal supportive care, are not attributable to the disease under investigation, where the investigator considers the AE of concern to be specifically associated with capivasertib.  Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related toxicities are shown in Table 8.  Appropriate and optimal treatment of the toxicity is assumed prior to considering dose modifications.  The Study Physician may be consulted prior to discontinuation of study drug due to toxicities.  Please see Section 8.3.12.3 for the management of capivasertib-specific toxicities including hyperglycaemia, maculo-papular rash and other skin reactions, and diarrhoea.

In participants who are diabetic, it may be beneficial to rule out concomitant aetiologies that could be associated with hyperglycaemia (eg, infections, dehydration, vascular events, glucocorticoids). Participants should be made aware of symptoms of hyperglycaemia (eg, polydipsia and polyuria). Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related hyperglycaemia are shown in Table 9.  In addition, for all grades, participants may receive education on lifestyle changes (eg, a diabetic diet) and consider beginning home glucose monitoring (eg, fasting self-blood glucose monitoring once daily) at the discretion of the investigator.  If glucose home monitoring is instituted, the capivasertib\/placebo treatment decision should be based on the morning fasting glucose value obtained prior to the dose of capivasertib\/placebo. It is recommended that approaches to the management of capivasertib-induced hyperglycaemia include advice from a diabetologist where appropriate (eg, participants with diabetes).  Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies (see below for further guidance).  If a second agent is required, consideration should be given to the intermittent schedule of capivasertib and the pattern of glucose changes (eg, sulphonylureas should be avoided due to the risk of hypoglycaemia secondary to their mechanism of action).

NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0; SBGM, self-blood glucose monitoring. Use of metformin Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies.  Investigators should exercise caution in the dosing and management of participants receiving the metformin and capivasertib\/placebo combination and must be vigilant for signs of renal impairment and metformin toxicity, such as lactic acidosis and hypoglycaemia, namely: lethargy, hypotension, poor urine output, drowsiness, irritation, tachypnoea, sweating, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Due to the potential interaction of metformin and capivasertib (caused by the inhibition of renal transporters [eg, OCT2] involved in the excretion of metformin), when taking both capivasertib and metformin concurrently, participants should attend the clinic for monitoring of serum creatinine at least once per week for the first 3 weeks after initiation of metformin, then every 3 weeks thereafter. Metformin should only be given on the days when capivasertib\/placebo is also administered (the half-life of capivasertib is approximately 7 to 15 hours) and should be withdrawn when treatment with capivasertib\/placebo is withdrawn, unless otherwise clinically indicated. Consider withholding of metformin on the days when participants are due to have imaging with contrast (in order to reduce the already low risk of lactic acidosis) as per local guidelines. Maculo-papular Rash Dose modifications for capivasertib-related maculo-papular rash, which is the most frequent skin toxicity observed in participants treated with capivasertib, are provided in Table 10.  However, these management guidelines can be used for other skin toxicities at the discretion of the investigator and\/or following consultation with the dermatologist.

BSA, body surface area; NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. Hypersensitivity In the case of hypersensitivity reactions, capivasertib\/placebo should be discontinued, and symptomatic\/supportive therapy should be initiated (including with antihistamines and\/or steroids) as considered appropriate by the investigator\/treating physician.  Drug re-challenge is not recommended; any subsequent consideration on re-challenge with capivasertib at the same or a lower dose, with its potential for recurrence of such or more severe events should be carefully considered against the potential benefits to the individual participant from continuation of capivasertib therapy and agreed with the sponsor.  Further management should follow local guidelines on management of hypersensitivity reactions. Diarrhoea Participants should be instructed to promptly contact investigators if they develop diarrhoea. Alternative aetiologies should be ruled out prior to initiating the dose modifications.  Investigators are recommended to prescribe anti-diarrhoeal treatment at the first visit so that participants can start treatment at the first sign of diarrhoea, should it occur.  Loperamide is the preferred anti-diarrhoeal agent for the management of diarrhoea occurring in participants participating in studies of capivasertib.  If diarrhoea is reported, additional details regarding this AE will be collected in the eCRF. Dose modifications for capivasertib-related diarrhoea are provided in Table 11.

Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG abnormalities should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria, are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product or are considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the investigator (which may include but not limited to consideration as to whether treatment or non-planned visits were required or other action was taken with the study treatment, eg, dose adjustment or drug interruption). If deterioration in a laboratory value\/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result\/vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE\/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally related to the disease under study (see Section 8.3.8)."

The Study Physician may be consulted prior to discontinuation of study drug due to toxicities.

In participants who are diabetic, it may be beneficial to rule out concomitant aetiologies that could be associated with hyperglycaemia (eg, infections, dehydration, vascular events, glucocorticoids). Participants should be made aware of symptoms of hyperglycaemia (eg, polydipsia and polyuria). Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related hyperglycaemia are shown in Table 9.  In addition, for all grades, participants may receive education on lifestyle changes (eg, a diabetic diet) and consider beginning home glucose monitoring (eg, fasting self-blood glucose monitoring once daily) at the discretion of the investigator.  If glucose home monitoring is instituted, the capivasertib\/placebo treatment decision should be based on the morning fasting glucose value obtained prior to the dose of capivasertib\/placebo. It is recommended that approaches to the management of capivasertib-induced hyperglycaemia include advice from a diabetologist where appropriate (eg, participants with diabetes).  Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies (see below for further guidance).  If a second agent is required, consideration should be given to the intermittent schedule of capivasertib and the pattern of glucose changes (eg, sulphonylureas should be avoided due to the risk of hypoglycaemia secondary to their mechanism of action).

Use of metformin Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies.  Investigators should exercise caution in the dosing and management of participants receiving the metformin and capivasertib\/placebo combination and must be vigilant for signs of renal impairment and metformin toxicity, such as lactic acidosis and hypoglycaemia, namely: lethargy, hypotension, poor urine output, drowsiness, irritation, tachypnoea, sweating, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Due to the potential interaction of metformin and capivasertib (caused by the inhibition of renal transporters [eg, OCT2] involved in the excretion of metformin), when taking both capivasertib and metformin concurrently, participants should attend the clinic for monitoring of serum creatinine at least once per week for the first 3 weeks after initiation of metformin, then every 3 weeks thereafter. Metformin should only be given on the days when capivasertib\/placebo is also administered (the half-life of capivasertib is approximately 7 to 15 hours) and should be withdrawn when treatment with capivasertib\/placebo is withdrawn, unless otherwise clinically indicated. Consider withholding of metformin on the days when participants are due to have imaging with contrast (in order to reduce the already low risk of lactic acidosis) as per local guidelines. Maculo-papular Rash Dose modifications for capivasertib-related maculo-papular rash, which is the most frequent skin toxicity observed in participants treated with capivasertib, are provided in Table 10.  However, these management guidelines can be used for other skin toxicities at the discretion of the investigator and\/or following consultation with the dermatologist.

BSA, body surface area; NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. Hypersensitivity In the case of hypersensitivity reactions, capivasertib\/placebo should be discontinued, and symptomatic\/supportive therapy should be initiated (including with antihistamines and\/or steroids) as considered appropriate by the investigator\/treating physician.  Drug re-challenge is not recommended; any subsequent consideration on re-challenge with capivasertib at the same or a lower dose, with its potential for recurrence of such or more severe events should be carefully considered against the potential benefits to the individual participant from continuation of capivasertib therapy and agreed with the sponsor.  Further management should follow local guidelines on management of hypersensitivity reactions. Diarrhoea Participants should be instructed to promptly contact investigators if they develop diarrhoea. Alternative aetiologies should be ruled out prior to initiating the dose modifications.  Investigators are recommended to prescribe anti-diarrhoeal treatment at the first visit so that participants can start treatment at the first sign of diarrhoea, should it occur.  Loperamide is the preferred anti-diarrhoeal agent for the management of diarrhoea occurring in participants participating in studies of capivasertib.  If diarrhoea is reported, additional details regarding this AE will be collected in the eCRF. Dose modifications for capivasertib-related diarrhoea are provided in Table 11.

Placebo-Controlled Study Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of Capivasertib + Abiraterone Versus Placebo + Abiraterone as Treatment for Patients with De Novo Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC) Characterised by PTEN deficiency (CAPItello-281) Short Title: Capivasertib + Abiraterone as Treatment for Patients with Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Characterised by PTEN deficiency. Rationale: There is an important unmet medical need for treatments in the de novo mHSPC setting that are able to delay cancer progression and ultimately, death, particularly in patients whose tumours are characterised by PTEN deficiency.  Available nonclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the combined inhibition of serine\/threonine specific protein kinase (AKT) and the androgen receptor (AR) axis may improve treatment outcomes in mHSPC.  The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib and the androgen biosynthesis inhibitor abiraterone combined with a steroid, given on a background of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated mHSPC and PTEN-deficient tumours.

For Exploratory objectives and endpoints, see Section 3 of the CSP. Overall Design This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, global study, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of capivasertib versus placebo, when added to abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) on a background of ADT in participants with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC characterised by PTEN deficiency.  PTEN status will be confirmed by investigational IHC testing of tumour tissue at central laboratories.  A participant cannot be randomised until a valid PTEN IHC result indicates PTEN deficiency.  Participants will be recruited globally from approximately 30 countries and approximately 350 study sites in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and Asia (including China and Japan). Participants will be randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive either capivasertib or matching placebo, in combination with abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) on a background of ADT.  The randomisation scheme will be stratified on the following factors: Combination of volume of disease according to CHAARTED criteria* and presence of visceral metastases** (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease) * High volume (defined as the presence of visceral metastases or \u2265 4 bone lesions with \u2265 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis) versus low volume. ** For the purposes of this study, visceral metastases are defined by the list provided within the IWRS. Geographic location: North America, Western Europe, and Australia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and Asia. Disclosure Statement: This is a parallel-group treatment study with 2 arms that is participant, sponsor, and investigator blinded. Number of Participants: Approximately 5500 participants will be enrolled and screened to achieve a total of 1000 randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 treatment arms.  This is based on the planned number of 331 rPFS events that must be observed for the study to have 90% power to show a statistically significant difference in rPFS at the 2-sided 5% level, assuming a true treatment effect HR of 0.70 (see Section 9.2 for details). For regulatory submission purposes in China, the study will include approximately 150 randomised participants from sites in mainland China and those from Taiwan and Hong Kong accredited by the National Medical Product Administration (NMPA). Note: \u2018Enrolled' means a participant's, or their legally acceptable representative's, agreement to participate in a clinical study following completion of the informed consent process.  Potential participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the study, but are not randomly assigned in the study, are considered \u2018screen failures', unless otherwise specified by the protocol. Intervention Groups and Duration: Participants will receive oral treatment with capivasertib or matching placebo 400 mg twice daily (BD) 4 days on, 3 days off, until investigator-assessed disease progression by RECIST 1.1 or PCWG3 bone progression criteria, unacceptable toxicity, or the participant requests to stop the treatment.  Participants will also receive the approved oral dose of abiraterone (1000 mg once daily) with 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone daily.  All participants should also receive continuous ADT using either a LHRH agonist, a LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy. If either abiraterone or capivasertib\/placebo is discontinued prior to disease progression, participants may remain on the other drug at the investigator's discretion until disease progression or evidence of unacceptable toxicity. Data Monitoring Committee: An independent Data Monitoring Committee will assess the progress of the study at regular intervals.  This will include reviewing unblinded safety and tolerability data and the data from the interim efficacy analysis to provide a recommendation to AstraZeneca as to whether the study should continue unchanged, be stopped, or be modified in any way. Statistical Methods: The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be used as the primary population for reporting efficacy data and to summarise baseline characteristics.  This comprises all participants randomised into the study and will be analysed according to randomised treatment regardless of the treatment received (ITT principle).  Any important deviations from randomised treatment will be listed and considered when interpreting the efficacy data.  The Safety Analysis Set will be used as the primary population for reporting safety data.  This comprises all participants randomised into the study who receive at least 1 dose of capivasertib or placebo and will be analysed according to the treatment received.  If a participant receives at least 1 dose of capivasertib they will be included in the capivasertib arm for safety summaries. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy, measured by rPFS, of capivasertib + abiraterone versus placebo + abiraterone, both groups receiving continuous ADT.  The primary endpoint is rPFS in participants who have de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC characterised by PTEN deficiency who have received no prior pharmacotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery for metastatic prostate cancer other than that which is permitted by the protocol and may have been administered for a maximum of 3 months from start of ADT to randomisation in the study.  The effect of capivasertib versus placebo will be tested using a log rank test stratified by the randomisation stratification factors.  If there are insufficient events per strata, some strata will be collapsed following rules to be pre-specified in the SAP.  From a stratified Cox proportional hazards model (ties = Efron) the HR (capivasertib + abiraterone versus placebo + abiraterone) together with its corresponding 95% CI will be presented.  A HR < 1 will favour capivasertib + abiraterone. The key secondary endpoints of OS, TFST, SSE-FS, and TTPP will be tested following a MTP to preserve the overall type 1 error (familywise error rate) in the strong sense.  Each endpoint will have its own alpha spending function and will be tested according to the group-sequential Holm variable (GSHv) procedure (Ye et al 2013).  TFST will be analysed at the rPFS interim and final analyses.  OS, SSE-FS, and TTPP will be analysed at the final rPFS analysis and again, approximately 12 months after the final rPFS analysis. The primary endpoint of rPFS (based on investigator assessment using RECIST version 1.1 [soft tissue] and PCWG3 [bone]) will be tested in an interim analysis after 222 (22% maturity) rPFS events have occurred.  With 222 events, a significant result will be declared if the observed rPFS HR is 0.593 or better at this interim analysis with a 2-sided p-value < 0.0001 (approximate relative information fraction = 67%).  The interim analysis on rPFS will be incorporated into the MTP including the key secondary endpoints, which will be analysed using the same methodology specified for the primary endpoint. When the final rPFS analysis is performed it is estimated that approximately 331 (33%) of the 1000 participants will have progressed, according to the definition of rPFS: the time from randomisation to radiographic progression assessed by investigator using RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 (bone) criteria, or death. Safety and tolerability data will be summarised using appropriate descriptive statistics. 1.2  Schema Figure 1  Study Design None a  High volume is defined as the presence of visceral metastases or \u2265 4 bone lesions with \u2265 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis (Sweeney et al 2015).

Screening will be conducted in a 2-part process which must be completed within a 3-month period between the participant starting ADT and being randomised to study treatment.  This 3-month period may also include abiraterone treatment.  Screening Part 1 includes testing for PTEN status.  In Part 2, all remaining screening assessments should be performed, and must be completed within 28 days before randomisation.  Screening Part 1 and Part 2 each require a separate ICF.  Participants under screening in Part 2 must be given sufficient time to complete the 7-day BPI-SF and BFI diaries.  Table 2 provides the SoA for the study treatment and follow-up periods.

The modality of the cardiac function assessments must be consistent within subject ie, if echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment and a follow-up assessment if clinically indicated, then echocardiogram should also be used for subsequent scans.  Participants should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible. c Participants will be required to provide the most recently collected tumour sample (bone metastases or Fine Needle Aspirate [FNA] samples will not be accepted), collected as part of routine clinical practice.  Availability of a tumour sample is mandatory for all patients to enrol in the study for the determination of PTEN status by IHC.  A representative FFPE tissue block that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides must be provided, or, if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual and Pathology Testing Manual.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1; no additional slides will be collected for screening Part 1 or Part 2. d Optional tumour sample: FFPE block (preferred) or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections can be provided.  These slides will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/ or diagnostic test development.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual and Pathology Testing Manual. e Not applicable for China participants. f Eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) are required to provide an additional tumour sample FFPE block (preferred) or 20 (minimum 15) freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  This sample will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/or diagnostic test development.  Patients who provided optional tissue in screening Part 1 are exempt from this requirement.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. g Blood sample for determination of PSA.  Mandatory for all participants on study.  Samples to be collected both at screening and at Cycle 1, Day 1. h Tumour assessment will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a whole-body bone scan.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before randomisation, and ideally should be performed as close as possible to the start of study treatment. i BPI-SF and BFI baseline assessments to be completed by the participant in a consecutive 7-day period during screening (only after PTEN deficiency is confirmed) before randomisation (not required to be at site). j In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs\/SAEs must be reported.

Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) relative to the date of randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), regardless of discontinuation of study treatment (eg, discontinuation due to toxicity or clinical progression) or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy.

If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at the participant's scheduled visits.  It is important to follow the imaging assessment schedule as closely as possible; however, tumour assessment can be performed at any time when disease progression is clinically suspected.  For participants who have at least 2 new bone lesions appearing on the first post-baseline scan, confirmation of progression will be required by an additional bone scan showing 2 or more new lesions compared to the first post-baseline bone scan at least 6 weeks later (for further detail please see Appendix E). l For the BPI-SF and BFI, the C1D1 assessment is part of the 7-day diaries completed at screening (see Table 1). m The PRO-CTCAE will only be administered where a linguistically validated version exists for a country. n In addition to regular contacts at 12-week intervals, participants will be contacted in the 7 days following a specified date (data cut-off date) for survival analysis. o Participants will enter the PFS2 follow-up period once the participant has discontinued study treatment due to progressive disease by RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue lesions and\/or PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions.  In the survival follow-up period following PFS, all subsequent cancer therapies and vital status will be documented at least every 12 weeks until death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first.

None 2  INTRODUCTION Capivasertib (AZD5363), a novel pyrrolopyrimidine-derived compound, is a potent, selective inhibitor of the kinase activity of all 3 isoforms of AKT (Davies et al 2012).  AstraZeneca is developing capivasertib for use in combination with other anticancer agents for a range of therapeutic indications, including prostate cancer and breast cancer. The AKT serine\/threonine protein kinases (AKT1, AKT2, AKT3) are key downstream effectors of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway, mediating cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, and are activated in a wide range of malignancies (Lindsley 2010).  AKT activation in tumours is largely due to input from other signalling pathways upstream of AKT, including loss of PTEN function and mutations in the catalytic subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) (Yi and Lauring 2015). Investigators should be familiar with the current capivasertib Investigator's Brochure (IB). 2.1  Study Rationale This Phase 3 study is designed to compare capivasertib versus placebo, administered in combination with abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) and ADT as a treatment in patients with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC with tumour tissue characterised by PTEN deficiency.  The rationale for conducting the study is supported by the following: The important unmet medical need in this setting The capivasertib mechanism of action and nonclinical data with capivasertib Clinical data from a study with ipatasertib, an AKT inhibitor with a similar mechanism of action to capivasertib, given in combination with abiraterone in patients with prostate cancer. The background to the rationale is summarised below in Section 2.2. 2.2  Background Prostate cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer in men and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.  An estimated 1.3 million men worldwide were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018, accounting for 13% of the cancers diagnosed in men.  With an estimated 358,989 deaths in 2018, prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of death from cancer in men (6.7% of the total deaths from cancer in men) (Globocan 2018). In the advanced disease setting, ADT with either orchiectomy or medical castration with GnRH analogues is highly effective in shrinking tumour burden, decreasing PSA levels, and enhancing quality of life.  Recent studies demonstrated the benefits (including improved survival) in patients with mHSPC of adding docetaxel (Gravis et al 2016, James et al 2016, Sweeney et al 2015) or the androgen biosynthesis inhibitor abiraterone (Fizazi et al 2017, James et al 2017, Mottet et al 2018) to ADT.  Other NHAs, enzalutamide and apalutamide, have also demonstrated benefit in this population (Armstrong et al 2019, Chi et al 2019, Davis et al 2019).  Unfortunately, despite the benefits of these combination therapies, mHSPC inevitably progresses to a castration-resistant phenotype, which is not yet curable, with 90% of overall mortality attributable to the underlying malignant disease (Scher et al 2015). Patients with de novo mHSPC are at higher risk of progressing to a castration-resistant disease state than those with prostate cancer that has progressed to metastasis after treatment for what was initially localised or locally advanced disease (referred to as \u2018recurrent mHSPC'), as demonstrated by shorter median OS and time to castration resistance (Francini et al 2018, Francini et al 2019, Gravis et al 2015).  In addition, loss of PTEN gene expression in prostate cancer is associated with features of more aggressive disease and poor prognosis; patients with PTEN loss at diagnosis have increased risk of recurrence and poorer survival (Ahearn et al 2015, Chaux et al 2012, Cuzick et al 2013, Lotan et al 2016, Reid et al 2010).  Thus, there is an important unmet medical need for treatments in the de novo mHSPC setting that are able to delay cancer progression and ultimately, death, particularly in patients whose tumours are characterised by PTEN deficiency. In nonclinical studies, capivasertib inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines that represent both hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant disease settings (Davies et al 2012, Liu and Dong 2014, Marques et al 2015).  Single-agent capivasertib also inhibited the growth of both androgen-dependent and castrate-resistant prostate tumour xenograft models (Thomas et al 2013), genetically engineered prostate tumours (De Velasco et al 2016), and patient-derived xenografts (Marques et al 2015).  Sensitivity to capivasertib correlated with loss of PTEN expression.  Inhibition of tumour growth in prostate tumour models with PI3K pathway inhibitors and specifically with capivasertib alone resulted in upregulation of the AR and AR-mediated gene expression (Carver et al 2011, Mulholland et al 2011, Thomas et al 2013, Marques et al 2015).  Since the AR and PI3K\/AKT pathways cross regulate one another through reciprocal feedback (Carver et al 2011, Mulholland et al 2011), the combined inhibition of AKT and the AR axis in prostate cancer may provide greater benefit than targeting either pathway alone. These nonclinical data for capivasertib are supported by the results of the Phase II randomised ASTON MARTIN study with ipatasertib, an AKT inhibitor with a similar mechanism of action to capivasertib.  The results showed that ipatasertib given in combination with abiraterone prolonged rPFS compared with abiraterone alone in patients with mCRPC and PTEN-deficient tumours.  In the ITT population, median rPFS was 8.2 months for the ipatasertib 400 mg group compared with 6.4 months for placebo: HR, 0.75 (90% CI: 0.54, 1.05).  In the PTEN-deficient group, median rPFS was 11.5 months on ipatasertib 400 mg compared with 4.6 months on placebo: HR, 0.39 (90% CI: 0.22, 0.70) (de Bono et al 2019).  The combination of ipatasertib and abiraterone is under evaluation in mCRPC in an ongoing Phase 3 study (NCT03072238), which is now fully enrolled. A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of capivasertib is provided in the IB. 2.3  Benefit-Risk Assessment 2.3.1  Risk Assessment Based on nonclinical and clinical data available to date, the risks associated with capivasertib are as follows: Identified Risks: nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, dry skin, pruritus, decreased appetite Important Identified Risks: diarrhoea, rash, hyperglycaemia, hypersensitivity Important Potential Risk: QT prolongation Overall, in the monotherapy intermittent dosage pool of patients in previous studies (n = 229), 42.4% of the 229 patients had SAEs, 17% of the 229 had causally related SAEs, and 3.1% were reported with SAEs leading to death.  There were no capivasertib treatment-related deaths in this pool.  A total of 17.5% patients were discontinued due to AEs, and a total of 11.4% were discontinued due to AEs that were considered related to capivasertib treatment. Diarrhoea As of the data cut-off (DCO) date of October 2019, diarrhoea (all grades) has been observed in 79.9% of patients on capivasertib monotherapy (intermittent dosing); most (84%) of these events have been of Grade 2 or lower, managed by dose modifications and supportive care (eg, loperamide), and have only resulted in a 1.3% incidence of drug discontinuation. Hyperglycaemia Hyperglycaemia has been observed with AKT inhibitors.  AKT inhibitor-induced hyperglycaemia is associated with induction of liver glycogenolysis as well as reduction in peripheral glucose uptake.  This effect may be exaggerated by steroid therapy which is co-administered with abiraterone.  Based on currently available data from AstraZeneca-sponsored studies, hyperglycaemia due to capivasertib tends to be transient and reversible on cessation of treatment.  There is a trend of an increase in plasma glucose levels peaking at approximately 4 hours post-dose, generally returning towards baseline levels at 8 hours and beyond.  Dose discontinuations due to AEs of hyperglycaemia were uncommon in previous studies (0.9% of patients).  There were no data to suggest that the transient hyperglycaemia associated with capivasertib treatment had clinically important consequences. Patients with Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes who require insulin treatment, and\/or patients who have glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) \u2265 8.0% (63.9 mmol\/mol) at screening, will be excluded from the study.  Fasting glucose and HbA1c will be monitored throughout the study.  Hyperglycaemia will be mitigated by dose modifications as per toxicity management guidelines, including administration of antidiabetic agents (eg, metformin) when required. Potential Effect on QT Interval Inhibition of the PI3K signalling pathway has been identified as a potential cause of drug-induced long QT syndrome via an inhibition of cardiac potassium currents (IKr, IKs) and an increase of the cardiac late sodium current.  Based on nonclinical data available, QT prolongation has been noted as important potential risk with capivasertib.  QT prolongation has been observed with ADT.  The clinical data available to date do not support any clinically relevant trend of QT prolongation.  Based on a concentration-response modelling analysis, the estimated mean QTcF change from baseline was 4.0 ms (90% CI: 2.9, 5.1 ms) at the therapeutic dose (400 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off) and steady state geometric mean Cmax, which gives an approximate 4- to 5-fold margin to the level of regulatory concern for oncology drugs (20 ms) (Garnett et al 2018).  In AstraZeneca-sponsored clinical studies with capivasertib, there were no reports of sudden death, torsades de pointes, or seizures.  Further details on the risks are available in Section 6 of the IB \u2018Summary of data and guidance for the investigators'.  The study eligibility criteria take into account a potential impact on QT interval.  GnRH analogues\/ADT are known to be associated with QTc prolongation. Ongoing Phase Ib Study D3618C00002 Capivasertib is being evaluated in combination with abiraterone and GnRH analogues in an ongoing Phase Ib study (D3618C00002) in patients with mCRPC.  Following review of the starting dose of capivasertib (400 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off) in combination with standard dose abiraterone (+ prednisone), the study's safety review committee concluded that there were no dose-limiting toxicities observed to preclude further study of the combination at this dose level (see Section 4.3). Externally-Sponsored Research Studies There are 17 externally-sponsored research studies with capivasertib ongoing, completed, or terminated.  Of these 17, 8 are investigating capivasertib specifically and a further 9 are \u201cumbrella\/basket\u201d studies in which capivasertib is an option in a panel of investigational drugs.  Key safety information reported to AstraZeneca by externally-sponsored research sponsors has been incorporated in the IB. 2.3.2  Benefit Assessment Hormonal therapy targeting the androgen axis remains the mainstay of initial treatment for mHSPC and typically gives rapid disease response and control; however, resistance to hormonal therapies inevitably occurs with time and the cancer starts to progress. PTEN-deficient prostate cancer is associated with higher Gleason score, tumour stage, and poorer prognosis.  The AR and PI3K\/AKT signalling networks cross regulate each other, and the combination of capivasertib with an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor is anticipated to enhance efficacy in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer.  Clinical and nonclinical data with capivasertib support the hypothesis that AKT inhibition may be a valid treatment strategy for mHSPC.  Capivasertib has demonstrated clinical activity in several settings including patients with advanced AKT1 mutant solid tumours as monotherapy or in combination with other agents.  The experimental agent ipatasertib has the same mode of action, and in a randomised Phase II study (ASTON MARTIN) in patients with CRPC, demonstrated meaningful improvement in rPFS when added to abiraterone and ADT (de Bono et al 2019). 2.3.3  Overall Benefit-Risk Conclusion The emerging safety profile of capivasertib from nonclinical and early clinical studies has not identified risks that would preclude investigation in this setting.  The study design aims to minimise potential risks in several ways.  First, the protocol includes safety monitoring in excess of standard of care monitoring, with the intent of protecting participants involved in the study.  Furthermore, investigators will be provided with a safety management strategy for the management of key toxicities, and monitoring is in place for those risks deemed to be most likely or serious.  Thus, based upon the clinical and nonclinical safety profile of capivasertib, the limited life expectancy due to malignant disease, and the strength of the scientific hypothesis under evaluation, the benefit-risk assessment for this study supports treatment with capivasertib given in addition to standard androgen suppression therapy in the form of abiraterone and LHRH analogue\/surgical castration in patients with mHSPC. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected AEs of capivasertib may be found in the IB. 3  OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS Table 3  Objectives and Endpoints Objectives  Objectives Endpoints  Endpoints Primary  Primary   None \u2022  To compare the effect of capivasertib + abiraterone relative to placebo + abiraterone by assessment of radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in patients with PTEN-deficient mHSPC.  \u2022  To compare the effect of capivasertib + abiraterone relative to placebo + abiraterone by assessment of radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in patients with PTEN-deficient mHSPC. \u2022  rPFS is defined as the time from randomisation to: 1) radiographic progression, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), or 2) death due to any cause.  \u2022  rPFS is defined as the time from randomisation to: 1) radiographic progression, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), or 2) death due to any cause.

Participants will be recruited globally from approximately 30 countries and approximately 350 study sites in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and Asia (including China and Japan). Approximately 5500 participants will be enrolled and screened to achieve a total of 1000 randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 treatment arms.  For regulatory submission purposes in China, the study will include approximately 150 randomised participants from sites in mainland China and those from Taiwan and Hong Kong accredited by the National Medical Product Administration (NMPA). Screening will be conducted in a 2-part process (see Figure 2), which must be completed within a 3-month period between the participant starting ADT and being randomised to study treatment.  In the 3-month period between screening Part 1 and randomisation, participants may be receiving abiraterone as well as ADT.  Part 1 will include those eligibility criteria marked with an asterisk (*) in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, and testing for PTEN status.  In Part 2, all remaining screening assessments will be performed, and must be completed within 28 days before randomisation.  The assessments to be performed at screening are shown in the SoA (Table 1). Figure 2  Two-part Screening Process None Table 1 shows the assessments to be completed in screening Parts 1 and 2. Eligible participants will have histologically confirmed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma, without small-cell features.  PTEN status is confirmed by IHC via central testing of tumour tissue using an Investigational Use Only (IUO) assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, USA).  For screening Part 1, patients are required to provide a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour sample, collected as part of routine clinical practice, for central testing.  This should preferably be a tissue block that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides, or if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides from the same block.  In addition, for screening Part 1 an optional tumour sample (FFPE block [preferred] or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections) can be provided.  These slides will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/or diagnostic test development.  Participants who provide this optional sample in Part 1 do not need to provide additional tumour sample for screening Part 2.  For screening Part 2, eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) will be required to provide an additional tumour sample FFPE block (preferred) or 20 (minimum 15) freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  This sample will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/or diagnostic test development.  Further details on tissue specifications are outlined in the Laboratory Manual and the Pathology Testing Manual as well as in Section 8.6.1.  A patient cannot be randomised until a valid, central laboratory tested PTEN IHC result indicates PTEN deficiency.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1; no additional slides will be collected for screening Part 2. Blood samples for analysis of ctDNA and other circulating biomarkers will also be collected and analysed (not applicable for China patients). Approximately 1000 participants will be randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive either capivasertib or placebo, in combination with abiraterone on a background of ADT.  It is expected that approximately 5500 potential participants will be screened.  The screen failure rate is estimated on the following assumptions: PTEN deficiency prevalence of 21% (screen failure rate of 79%), as well as a further 15% screen failure for other reasons (eg, informed consent\/ eligibility criteria\/PTEN IHC test failure rate).  Participants will receive oral treatment with capivasertib or placebo BD (4 days on and 3 days off) until progression or discontinuation.  Participants will also receive the approved oral dose of abiraterone (1000 mg once daily) with 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone daily.  All participants should also receive continuous ADT using either a LHRH agonist, a LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy. The randomisation scheme will be stratified on the following factors: Combination of volume of disease according to CHAARTED criteria and presence of visceral metastases (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease) Geographic location: North America, Western Europe, and Australia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and Asia. High volume disease is defined as the presence of either visceral metastases (or \u2265 4 bone metastases with \u2265 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis (Sweeney et al 2015).  For the purposes of this study, visceral metastases are defined by the list provided within the IWRS. An IDMC will assess the progress of the study at regular intervals.  This will include reviewing unblinded safety and tolerability data and the data from the interim efficacy analysis to provide a recommendation to AstraZeneca as to whether the study should continue unchanged, be stopped, or be modified in any way. Section 6.7 describes treatment intervention after the end of the study. 4.2  Scientific Rationale for Study Design Choice of Background Therapy At the time of initiation of this study, the Category 1 recommended treatment options for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer in the US include ADT in combination with docetaxel, abiraterone (+ prednisone), apalutamide, or enzalutamide, since these combinations have all reported OS improvement over ADT alone in randomised Phase III studies in this setting (NCCN 2019).  Alternatives include ADT with addition of radiation therapy (for low volume mHSPC) or ADT with abiraterone with methylprednisolone (Category 2B).  The European Association of Urology (EAU) treatment guidelines currently recommend a choice between abiraterone and chemotherapy as systemic treatment in addition to a background of ADT, irrespective of risk status (EAU guidelines 2019).  In patients with previously untreated mHSPC, docetaxel or abiraterone treatment resulted in an OS of 57.6 and 53.3 months respectively, and patients progress to mCRPC on average 33 months after start of treatment Fizazi et al 2017, Sweeney et al 2015).  Since mHSPC patients inevitably progress to a castration-resistant phenotype, therapeutic interventions that are able to delay the time to disease progression would address an important unmet medical need.  Although currently incurable, the disease is more amenable to intervention and a targeted treatment approach may bring additional benefits over AR-based treatments alone (Fizazi et al 2017). There is an increasing focus on the development of molecularly-targeted agents for individualised treatment in prostate cancer, eg, PARP inhibitors in patients with DNA repair pathway alteration (Mateo et al 2015, Mateo et al 2019, Hussain et al 2019).  Activation of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway is common in prostate cancer, predominantly due to PTEN loss (Robinson et al 2015, Abida et al 2017), and there is a reciprocal relationship between this pathway and the AR pathway, such that inhibition of one leads to upregulation of the other (Carver et al 2011).  Of note, PTEN loss has been shown to be an indicator of poor prognosis in prostate cancer; PTEN loss was associated with early biochemical recurrence, extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle involvement, and poorer cause-specific and overall survival, based on samples predominantly from patients with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer (Krohn et al 2012, Reid et al 2010, Troyer et al 2015). Evidence from clinical studies is emerging for the benefits of AKT inhibition in combination with abiraterone in the treatment of prostate cancer; eg, the Phase II ASTON MARTIN study of ipatasertib in combination with abiraterone in patients with mCRPC prolonged rPFS compared with abiraterone alone, especially in patients with PTEN-deficient tumours: median rPFS was 11.5 versus 4.6 months (de Bono et al 2019).  Since the proof of concept for AKT inhibition in a metastatic prostate cancer setting was obtained for ipatasertib in combination with abiraterone, enrolment into the present study is restricted to patients for whom abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) plus ADT is considered the optimal treatment approach by the treating investigator; patients requiring another treatment modality such as docetaxel or radiotherapy are not eligible. In summary, although abiraterone is an approved therapy and is a recommended treatment option for patients with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC in current evidence-based guidelines, there is still a significant unmet medical need in this population.  In particular, patients with PTEN-deficient tumours may experience improved treatment outcomes from the addition of a molecularly targeted agent, including those that specifically inhibit the PI3K\/AKT pathway.  Therefore, addition of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib to standard abiraterone therapy could improve treatment outcomes in mHSPC patients with PTEN-deficient tumours and delay the development of castration resistance. Abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA\u00ae) is converted in vivo to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor.  Specifically, abiraterone selectively inhibits the enzyme 17\u03b1 hydroxylase\/C17,20 lyase (CYP17).  This enzyme is expressed in, and is required for, androgen biosynthesis in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumour tissues.  CYP17 catalyses the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone into testosterone precursors, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione, respectively, by 17\u03b1-hydroxylation and cleavage of the C17,20 bond.  CYP17 inhibition also results in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals.  Abiraterone was first approved (in combination with prednisone) for the treatment of mCRPC.  The indication has since been extended to include the treatment of newly diagnosed high-risk mHSPC (ZYTIGA Prescribing Information 2019, Zytiga SmPC 2019). The approval of abiraterone in mHSPC was supported by 2 large randomised controlled studies demonstrating the survival and other patient-relevant benefits of abiraterone given in addition to ADT: STAMPEDE (Arm G) (James et al 2017) and LATITUDE (Fizazi et al 2017, Fizazi et al 2019).  The LATITUDE study (unlike STAMPEDE) required all participants to have high-risk mHSPC, defined by having at least 2 of the following: Gleason score of \u2265 8, \u2265 3 bone metastases, or the presence of visceral metastases.  The reduction in the risk of death was nearly identical between the two studies, with a HR of 0.62, also confirmed in a meta-analysis.  Furthermore, post hoc analyses of STAMPEDE demonstrated that abiraterone achieved positive outcomes in men with mHSPC (including rPFS and OS) regardless of low or high burden of disease.  The definition of \u2018low volume' versus \u2018high volume' disease was based on the CHAARTED criteria (presence of either visceral metastases or > 3 bone metastases).  Risk status (\u2018low risk' vs \u2018high risk') was defined using the LATITUDE criteria (Hoyle et al 2019; Sweeney et al 2015, Fizazi et al 2017).  In addition to the effects on failure-free survival and OS in STAMPEDE, significant benefits of add-on abiraterone were also seen for PROs in LATITUDE, including progression of pain, prostate cancer symptoms, fatigue, functional decline, and overall HRQoL (Chi et al 2018). Based on the studies and clinical practice guidelines discussed above, abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) plus ADT combination therapy currently is a recommended standard-of-care first-line option for the treatment of men with de novo mHSPC, irrespective of risk status or disease volume (EAU guidelines 2019, Mottet et al 2018, NCCN 2019, Parker et al 2015, Parker et al 2017). Study Population The study population is associated with considerable unmet medical need, as described in Section 2.2. The rationale for the inclusion of participants with mHSPC without high-risk features in this study is based on the analyses from the STAMPEDE study, which demonstrated that abiraterone achieved positive efficacy outcomes for both rPFS and OS in the target patient population, regardless of risk status (James et al 2017).  In addition, as noted above, classifying patients with prostate cancer for treatment based on risk status is not distinguished within treatment guidelines, and is not routinely done in the clinic. Only adenocarcinomas without small-cell histology are allowed; this is consistent with the LATITUDE study (Fizazi et al 2017), which was the primary basis for the approval of abiraterone in mHSPC. The presence of metastatic disease will be confirmed using standard imaging techniques that are widely used in the staging of prostate cancer in routine clinical practice, with RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 principles adopted for assessment of metastatic lesions. Only patients with ECOG performance status 0 or 1 are eligible, in line with guidelines recommending that abiraterone should be offered only to patients with ECOG status 0 or 1. The use of mild opioid analgesics for cancer-related pain, bisphosphonates and denosumab for management of bone-related metastases, LHRH analogues (ie, ADT) to maintain testosterone < 50 ng\/dL, conventional multivitamins and selenium, prednisone dose increases and eplerenone to manage refractory mineralocorticoid-related toxicities, transfusions and haematopoietic growth factors will all be permitted during the study.  However, where possible, these will be kept at a stable dose to allow accurate characterisation of the capivasertib treatment effect. Stratification Factors The randomisation scheme will be stratified based a combination of volume of disease and presence of visceral metastases, and also geographic location (as described in Section 4.1). Volume of disease as determined by the CHAARTED criteria is considered a key prognostic factor in prostate cancer.  High volume disease is defined as the presence of visceral metastases or \u2265 4 bone lesions with \u2265 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis.  Although abiraterone has been shown to provide benefit to patients with mHSPC in each risk status and volume subgroup, the overall prognosis as measured by median failure-free survival, PFS, and OS was markedly shorter in patients with high disease volume (Hoyle et al 2019).  This prognostic effect is further supported by analyses of other agents in mHSPC (Sweeney et al 2015, Stenzl et al 2019). Presence of visceral metastases is a known prognostic factor in prostate cancer and was incorporated into both the LATITUDE risk and CHAARTED disease volume criteria.  However, visceral tumour sites (eg, lung and liver metastases) were shown to be independently related to worse prognosis in a meta-analysis of 8802 men with prostate cancer (Halabi at al 2016).  The combination of volume of disease (high versus low) according to CHAARTED criteria and presence of visceral metastases results in a stratification factor with 3 levels (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease), as according to the definition, patients with low disease volume would not have visceral metastases.  For the purposes of this study, visceral metastases are defined by the list provided within the IWRS. The geographic split of Western Europe, Australia plus United States, Latin America plus Eastern Europe, and Asia was chosen to account for possible differences in PSA screening, and healthcare accessibility and quality in different regions that could affect both the primary treatment outcome and post study (eg, OS) endpoints. Study Endpoints The definition of rPFS (see Section 8.1.2.1) is considered to be consistent with EMA guidance in the prostate cancer-specific appendix to the Guideline on the Evaluation of Anticancer Medicinal Products in Man (EMA 2015) which recognises PFS as an acceptable primary endpoint.  PFS is also listed in the FDA's table of surrogate endpoints and has supported prior approvals in prostate cancer (FDA 2019).  Reducing the risk of radiographic progression is of clinical importance given the strong positive correlation reported for PFS and OS in patients with mCRPC.  Also, a recent study of enzalutamide in patients with mHSPC (ARCHES; Armstrong et al 2019) which was the basis of the recent FDA approval and positive opinion adopted by the CHMP for this indication, utilised rPFS as the primary endpoint.  The Phase III study supporting the FDA approval of apalutamide used rPFS as a dual primary endpoint (with OS) (Chi et al 2019). The median OS for the mHSPC patient population treated with ADT and abiraterone is over 5 years.  It is considered that an unfeasibly large and long study (more than 4000 patients and a study duration of over 11 years) would be required to obtain sufficient statistical power to detect OS differences in a reasonable timeframe.  However, the study population will be followed up after the primary analysis for rPFS for longer term endpoints, including OS. The key secondary efficacy endpoints for this study have been widely adopted in clinical studies in patients with prostate cancer and overall, are considered to represent the most clinically meaningful events for patients.  Prostate cancer typically metastasises to bone and is associated with risk of pathological fractures, spinal cord compression and severe pain with detrimental impact on quality of life.  Reducing the risk of developing symptomatic skeletal-related events and delaying the onset of pain are considered highly clinically relevant endpoints in the context of prostate cancer. The study includes several PRO endpoints, of which AstraZeneca considers the measurement of pain as the most relevant measure of the patient experience with mHSPC, and will be an alpha-controlled secondary endpoint, defined based on the BPI-SF worst pain (Item 3) and analgesic use.  Additionally, a comprehensive evaluation of fatigue, symptoms, impacts, treatment tolerability, and HRQoL will provide a totality of PRO evidence. 4.3  Justification for Dose Several doses and schedules have been investigated for capivasertib.  In the capivasertib clinical programme as of 04 October 2019 (the DCO for the current IB), approximately 1150 patients had been exposed to capivasertib as monotherapy or in combination with other agents: approximately 480 patients in AstraZeneca-sponsored studies and 672 in Investigator-sponsored studies.  More detailed information may be found in the IB. The recommended regimen for monotherapy (480 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off) was selected based on pharmacodynamic parameters from tumour biopsies, PK data, and clinical safety.  The recommended regimen of capivasertib with paclitaxel or with fulvestrant is 400 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off. Clinical studies with the AKT inhibitor ipatasertib have demonstrated efficacy and favourable tolerability in different tumour types at the same dose (400 mg QD continuously), namely in TNBC with the paclitaxel combination (LOTUS study; Kim et al 2017) and in prostate cancer with the abiraterone combination (ASTON MARTIN Phase II study; de Bono et al 2019). Therefore, the capivasertib dose regimen (400 mg BD, 4 days on, 3 days off), which has demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in randomised Phase II studies in metastatic TNBC (PAKT; Schmid et al 2020) and HR+ advanced breast cancer (FAKTION; Jones et al 2019), is hypothesised to be effective and tolerable also in prostate cancer. Since no major influence of gender or age has been observed on the PK of capivasertib and the risk of PK interactions between capivasertib and abiraterone + prednisone\/prednisolone in combination with GnRH analogues is low, similar systemic exposure is expected in the prostate cancer population as in the breast cancer populations. The conversion of abiraterone acetate to its active metabolite abiraterone is likely through esterase activity and is not CYP-mediated.  Abiraterone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and capivasertib is a direct and time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  However, co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of abiraterone.  Abiraterone has the potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and to a lesser extent CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4\/5.  Capivasertib is primarily metabolised by UGT2B7 and CYP3A4.  In vitro, abiraterone and its major metabolites were shown to inhibit the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1.  There are no clinical data available to confirm transporter-based interactions. Clinically relevant interactions between capivasertib and prednisone\/prednisolone are unlikely.  Drugs which inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of corticosteroids.  The strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%.  However, capivasertib is not a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 based on in vitro results and PBPK simulations.  Glucocorticoids are moderate inducers of CYP3A4, but capivasertib is unlikely to be a sensitive substrate of CYP3A4.  The risk for drug-drug interactions between capivasertib and GnRH analogues is low.  These drugs are peptides, metabolised by peptidases, so it is unlikely that they would be affected by CYP450 inhibitors. The ongoing Phase Ib Study D3618C00002 in patients with mCRPC is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and PK of capivasertib in combination with abiraterone (+ prednisone\/ prednisolone) and GnRH analogues.  After review of the first dose level (400 mg BD, 4 days on, 3 days off) in combination with standard dose abiraterone + prednisone in n=8 patients with heavily pretreated mCPRC, the safety review committee concluded that there were no dose-limiting toxicities observed to preclude further study of the combination at this dose level.  The capivasertib PK was as predicted from previous studies where capivasertib was given as monotherapy.  Thus, the capivasertib dosing regimen of 400 mg BD, 4 days on, 3 days off, is selected for the present study in combination with abiraterone and ADT.  This regimen is also being examined in the Phase 3 breast cancer programme (CAPItello-290\/D3614C00001 and CAPItello-291\/D3615C00001, in combination with paclitaxel or with fulvestrant, respectively). Guidelines for modification of the capivasertib\/placebo dose in the present study are provided in Section 6.6. 4.4  End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study when they have completed all phases of the study including their last scheduled visit or their last scheduled procedure in the SoA (Table 2). The end of the study is defined as the date of last expected visit\/contact of the last participant undergoing the study. 5  STUDY POPULATION Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrolment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted. Following written informed consent, all participants will undergo central PTEN status assessment using the IHC assay (see Section 6.1.2) and initial eligibility criteria review, as defined by the marked criteria (*) in Section 5.1 (inclusion criteria) and Section 5.2 (exclusion criteria), below. 5.1  Inclusion Criteria Participants are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria apply: Age 1  *Participant must be \u2265 18 years of age (\u2265 20 years of age in Japan), at the time of signing the informed consent. Type of Participant and Disease Characteristics *Histologically-confirmed de novo (ie, diagnosed within 3 months of randomisation) metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma.  Note: adenocarcinoma must be the primary histological pattern and patients with small-cell tumours are not eligible. *Consent to provide a FFPE tissue block (preferred) or slides.  Details on tissue requirements are specified in the Laboratory Manual.  Cytologic or FNA samples are not acceptable.  Tumour tissue from bone metastases is not acceptable. *A valid PTEN IHC result indicating PTEN deficiency (centralised testing). Metastatic disease documented prior to randomisation by clear evidence of \u2265 1 bone lesion (defined as 1 lesion with positive uptake on bone scan) and\/or \u2265 1 soft tissue lesion (measurable and\/or non-measurable) that can be accurately assessed at baseline and is suitable for repeated assessment with CT and\/or MRI.  Patients with metastatic disease identified by PSMA PET only, will not be eligible.  Local lymph node involvement is not considered metastatic disease. Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic form of prostate cancer based on the investigator's clinical evaluation. *Candidate for abiraterone and steroid therapy.  Previous treatment with abiraterone and\/or a steroid for de novo disease is allowed up to a maximum of 3 months prior to randomisation (prior treatment with chemotherapy or other NHAs is not allowed). Ongoing ADT with GnRH analogue (combination with first generation androgen receptor antagonists, eg, bicalutamide is allowed), or LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy.  Duration of ongoing ADT (regardless of method) is from 0 days to a maximum of 3 months prior to randomisation. ECOG\/WHO performance status 0 to 1 (see Appendix A) with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks. *Able and willing to swallow and retain oral medication. Participants must complete the 7-day BPI-SF and BFI questionnaires and the analgesic diary during screening (only after PTEN deficiency is confirmed), prior to randomisation.  Note: it is required to give participants at least 7 consecutive days to complete the assessments prior to randomisation.  If a minimum of 4 assessments is not completed during the 7-day period, participants must be re-screened, a new 7 days of questionnaire\/diary entries completed, and any screening tests which are consequently outside of the applicable 28 days prior to randomisation must also be repeated.  Sex *Participants will be male. Reproduction 13  Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm: Sterilisation (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). Participants should use barrier contraception (ie, condoms) from the time of screening until 16 weeks after discontinuation of study drug.  It is not known whether the pre-clinical changes seen in the male animal reproductive organs, after treatment with capivasertib, will be fully reversible or will permanently affect the ability to produce healthy sperm following treatment.  Therefore, if participants wish to father children, they should be advised to arrange for collection of sperm samples prior to the start of study treatment. Informed Consent *Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix B 3, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICF and in this CSP. Provision of signed and dated written Optional Genetic Research Information informed consent prior to collection of samples for optional genetic research that supports Genomic Initiative. 5.2  Exclusion Criteria Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply: Medical Conditions Radiotherapy with a wide field of radiation (eg, more than one-third of the skeleton) within 4 weeks before the start of study treatment (capivasertib\/placebo). Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access, transurethral resection of prostate, bilateral orchiectomy, or internal stents) within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment.

The clinical relevance of this is unknown, but until further information is available a conservative approach has been taken to recommend that participants fast from at least 2 hours before dosing to at least 1 hour after dosing, where possible.  Water can be allowed as desired. In addition, participants should avoid herbal supplements (eg, St John's wort) and ingestion of large amounts of foods and beverages known to potently modulate CYP3A4 enzyme activity, during study treatment.  For example, no more than half a grapefruit, a small glass of grapefruit juice or 2 teaspoons of Seville orange marmalade should be consumed daily.  Please refer to Appendix C for further guidance. Participants will be required to fast from at least 2 hours before until at least 1 hour after each dose of abiraterone, due to an effect of food on absorption.  Water can be allowed as desired. 5.3.2  Caffeine, Alcohol, and Tobacco No interactions with caffeine, alcohol or tobacco have been identified. 5.3.3  Contraception Participants must use a condom during treatment and for 16 weeks after the last dose of capivasertib when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential.  Female partners of male participants should also use a highly effective form of contraception (as described in Appendix D) if they are of childbearing potential.  Participants should not donate sperm throughout the period of taking capivasertib and for 3 months following the last dose of capivasertib. 5.3.4  Other Restrictions Participants who are blood donors should not donate blood during the study and for 3 months following their last dose of study treatment.  For blood donation after study participation, refer to WHO guidelines (WHO 2012). 5.4  Screen Failures Screen failures are defined as patients who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently randomised.  A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities.  Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any SAE.  If a patient is ineligible and not randomised, the IWRS should be contacted to terminate the participant in the system (screen failed). Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may be rescreened once (per screening part), upon the Study Physician's approval and agreement.  However, rescreening should be documented so that its effect on study results, if any, can be assessed.  These participants should have the reason for study withdrawal, including failed inclusion\/exclusion criteria, recorded in the eCRF.  Rescreened participants should be assigned the same participant number as for the initial screening. 6  STUDY INTERVENTION Study intervention is defined as any investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s), placebo, or medical device(s) intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study protocol.  Study intervention in this study refers to capivasertib or placebo, and abiraterone, administered from the date of randomisation. Abiraterone is indicated for use in combination with ADT, and it is also recommended that abiraterone is used with prednisone or prednisolone; for details see Section 6.5.1.  In this study, ADT, prednisone, and prednisolone are NIMPs\/background therapy, and these should be prescribed in accordance with local guidelines, where applicable. 6.1  Study Intervention(s) Administered 6.1.1  Investigational Products Details of the Investigational Products are provided in Table 4.

Where possible, all doses of capivasertib\/placebo should be taken at approximately the same time each day, 12 hours apart in a fasted state (water to drink only) from at least 2 hours prior to the dose to at least 1 hour post-dose.  Additional fasting restrictions apply on days where fasting glucose is to be tested (Section 8.2.4.1).  If vomiting occurs, a replacement dose should not be taken, and the participant should take their allotted dose at the next scheduled time. Should a participant miss a scheduled dose, the participant will be allowed to take the dose up to a maximum of 2 hours after the scheduled dose time, with a fasting state being maintained.  If greater than 2 hours after the scheduled dose time, the missed dose should not be taken, and the participant should take their allotted dose at the next scheduled time.  If a participant needs to take the dose earlier, the participant can take the dose up to 2 hours earlier than the scheduled dose time.  The participant should make every reasonable effort to take the capivasertib\/placebo tablet(s) on time. Any regular medication required by the participant can be taken at the same time as capivasertib\/placebo in a fasted state (as described above), provided that this does not contravene the dosing instructions in the prescribing information for that medication. Abiraterone should be taken under fasting conditions (only water to drink) from at least 2 hours prior to dosing to at least 1 hour post-dose.  The tablets should be swallowed whole with water and not crushed or chewed. 6.1.2  Medical Devices Documented PTEN deficiency of tumour tissue is required for selection of participants onto the study.  All participants must provide FFPE tumour tissue (block or slides) from primary or metastatic sites (excluding bone metastases or FNA samples) for IHC-based determination of PTEN deficiency.  Ventana Medical Systems (Tucson, USA) will provide the Investigational Use Only (IUO) assay for centralised PTEN IHC testing.  This assay is being developed for approval as a companion diagnostic for capivasertib. 6.2  Preparation\/Handling\/Storage\/Accountability of Interventions The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study intervention received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study intervention. Only participants randomised in the study may receive study intervention and only authorised site staff may supply or administer study intervention.  All study intervention must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labelled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorised site staff. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). Any study drug remaining at the end of the study must be destroyed or returned according to the sites local standard operating procedures following authorisation by the sponsor. 6.3  Measures to Minimise Bias: Randomisation and Blinding Eligible participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio (capivasertib + abiraterone: placebo + abiraterone) by a permuted block randomisation approach stratified on the following factors: Combination of volume of disease according to CHAARTED criteria and presence of visceral metastases (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease) Geographic location (North America, Western Europe, and Australia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and Asia). Capivasertib and placebo tablets will be identical and presented in the same packaging to ensure blinding of the capivasertib.  Capivasertib and placebo will be labelled using a unique kit identification (kit ID) number, which is linked to the randomisation scheme. All participants will be centrally assigned to randomised study treatment using an IWRS.  Before the study is initiated, the log-in information and directions for the IWRS will be provided to each study site. Abiraterone will be allocated to be dispensed to each participant using the IWRS system (if centrally sourced) or via the local pharmacy (if locally sourced) at each participant dispensing visit.  Routines for this will be described in the IWRS user manual that will be provided to each centre. Each patient will obtain a unique randomisation number via the IWRS. The actual treatment given to individual participants will be determined by a randomisation scheme that will be loaded into the IWRS database.  The randomisation scheme will be produced by a computer software program called AZRand (AZ Global Randomisation system) that incorporates a standard procedure for generating random numbers. A blocked randomisation will be generated, and all centres will use the same list in order to minimise any imbalance in the number of participants assigned to each treatment group. Eligibility will be established before treatment randomisation.  It is recommended that participants commence study treatment as soon as possible after randomisation and ideally on the same day of randomisation. If a participant withdraws from the study, then his enrolment\/randomisation code cannot be reused.  Withdrawn participants will not be replaced. The IWRS will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions.  In case of an emergency, in which the knowledge of the specific blinded study treatment will affect the immediate management of the participant's condition (eg, antidote available), the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participants' intervention assignment is warranted.  Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination.  If a participant's intervention assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind.  The investigator must document and report the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing to AstraZeneca staff the treatment that was given to the participant. AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an IMP and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities.  Randomisation codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual participant have been made and documented. 6.4  Study Intervention Compliance Data regarding capivasertib\/placebo dosing will be collected during the scheduled site visits and entered into the eCRF along with reasons for missed dose(s) if applicable. In addition, participants will be required to return all bottles of study medication at the start of the next cycle.  The number of tablets remaining will be counted by the research nurse\/ pharmacist\/investigator, documented in the eCRF and returned to pharmacy.  Site personnel are responsible for managing the IMP from receipt by the study site until the destruction or return of all unused IMP. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the participant has returned all unused IMP. 6.5  Concomitant Therapy Any medication or vaccine, including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and\/or herbal supplements, that the participant is receiving at the time of enrolment or receives during the study must be recorded along with: Reason for use Dates of administration including start and end dates Dosage information including dose and frequency This includes details relating to the ADT and prednisone\/prednisolone administered as standard background treatment with the abiraterone. Guidance regarding potential interactions of capivasertib with concomitant medications is provided in Appendix C. 6.5.1  Recommended Concomitant Therapy The following therapies are recommended during study participation, as applicable: Corticosteroids: In the treatment of patients with mHSPC, abiraterone is indicated for use with corticosteroid in the form of 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone daily in line with the locally approved abiraterone package insert.  An increased dose of the corticosteroid may be indicated during and after a stressful situation.  Participants will receive the treating investigator's choice of commercially available prednisone or prednisolone. Androgen deprivation therapy: Abiraterone is indicated for use in combination with ADT; therefore, participants must be receiving the treating investigator's choice of commercially available LHRH analogues or have received surgical castration. Anti-diarrhoeal therapy for symptomatic treatment of diarrhoea, as indicated in the toxicity management guideline (see Section 8.3.12.3). Antidiabetic therapy for management of hyperglycaemia (see Section 8.3.12.3). Concomitant medication may be given as medically indicated.  Details (including doses, frequency, route, and start and stop dates) of the concomitant medication given must be recorded in the participant's medical records and in the eCRF. 6.5.2  Restricted Concomitant Therapy The following concomitant therapies are restricted during study treatment: Other anticancer agents, other investigational agents and radiotherapy, although radiation for palliation at focal sites is permitted (as long as the radiation field covers less than 30% of the marrow and does not include whole pelvis or spine; disease progression in the bones has to be excluded by appropriate imaging investigations). Drugs or herbal supplements that are known to be potent inhibitors\/inducers of CYP3A4, as they may increase\/decrease the exposure and thus, affect the toxicity\/efficacy of capivasertib. Drugs known to be sensitive to inhibition of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and\/or CYP2D6 metabolism and\/or MATE1 or OCT2 transport, and which have a narrow therapeutic window; see Appendix C for details.  If co-administration is necessary, then additional monitoring for signs of toxicity related to increased exposure to the substrates is required. The concomitant administration of drugs known to prolong the QT interval is restricted unless considered essential due to participant management, in which case, participants should be closely monitored.  Information regarding drugs known to prolong the QT interval can be found at URL: https:\/\/crediblemeds.org. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers and CYP2D6 substrates with abiraterone; for more details on restrictions and cautions required when administering concomitant medications with abiraterone, please refer to abiraterone local prescribing information. Patients are not eligible to enter the study if they have received any of the medications specified in the exclusion criteria or are unable to observe the cautions and restrictions for restricted therapies (for details please compare Section 5.2 and Appendix C). 6.5.3  Other Concomitant Treatment Supportive care, and other medication, other than that described in Section 6.5.2, considered necessary for the participant's safety and well-being, may be given at the discretion of the investigator and recorded in the appropriate sections of the eCRF. 6.6  Dose Modification 6.6.1  Dose Modification for Capivasertib Dose reductions or holds are allowed as clinically indicated by the treating physician and in line with Table 5.  For each participant, a maximum of 2 dose reductions will be allowed for capivasertib\/placebo.  Dose re-escalations are not allowed for either capivasertib\/placebo. Dose reductions for capivasertib\/placebo should be carried out as described in Table 5.  The dose of capivasertib\/placebo can be reduced twice (initially, reduction to dose reduction level 1; subsequently, in case of occurrence of further \u2265 grade 3 toxicity, further reduction to dose reduction level 2).  For guidance on dose reductions for management of capivasertib related AEs, refer to Section 8.3.12. Table 5  Dose Levels for Capivasertib\/Placebo Study Treatment  Study Treatment Starting Dose  Starting Dose Dose Reduction Levels  Dose Reduction Levels Capivasertib\/placebo  Capivasertib\/placebo 400 mg twice daily  400 mg twice daily Reduction level 1: 320 mg twice daily  Reduction level 1: 320 mg twice daily Reduction level 2: 200 mg twice daily  Reduction level 2: 200 mg twice daily Study Treatment Starting Dose Dose Reduction Levels Capivasertib\/placebo 400 mg twice daily Reduction level 1: 320 mg twice daily Reduction level 2: 200 mg twice daily In the event of an AE which the investigator considers to be related to the administration of study treatment, supportive therapy should be given at the discretion of the investigator.  In addition, the investigator may decide that dosing of study treatment should be temporarily interrupted, a subsequent treatment cycle delayed, or study treatment permanently discontinued as per the guidelines outlined in Section 7.1. Substantial acute toxicities should be managed as medically indicated and with temporary suspension of study drug, as appropriate. A maximum break of 4 consecutive weeks is allowed within each treatment cycle or between 2 consecutive cycles.  Following a treatment break the participant can resume treatment at the Day in the cycle that they stopped.  If the treatment break is longer than the maximum of 4 consecutive weeks, the investigator will need permission from the sponsor Study Physician to allow the participant to restart study treatment. 6.6.2  Dose Modification for Abiraterone In case dose reductions are necessary for abiraterone, the investigator should refer to abiraterone local prescribing information for further details.  These dose reductions should be documented in the eCRF. 6.7  Intervention after the End of the Study After the clinical study database closes, participants who continue to derive clinical benefit from study treatments in the opinion of the investigator may continue to receive study treatment until progression.  These treatments will continue to be provided by AstraZeneca until the availability of either a local commercial supplier and reimbursement programme or an early access programme; at which point a change in supply will be requested.  Treatment of participants beyond progression is not allowed. Please refer to Section 4.4 for End of Study definition. 7  DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION\/WITHDRAWAL 7.1  Discontinuation of Study Intervention Participants may be discontinued from study treatment (ie, capivasertib\/placebo or abiraterone) in the following situations.  Note that discontinuation from study treatment is NOT the same as a complete withdrawal from the study. Participants who discontinue either capivasertib\/placebo or abiraterone should continue to undergo assessments as outlined in the SoA (Table 2).  Participants who discontinue both capivasertib\/placebo and abiraterone should continue the efficacy assessments until disease progression and survival follow-up as outlined in the SoA (Table 2). Radiographic progressive disease is confirmed by the investigator (RECIST 1.1 or PCWG3 bone progression criteria). Clinical disease progression\/worsening of disease under investigation. Participants incorrectly initiated on IMP. Intercurrent illness that, in the judgment of the investigator, will affect assessments of clinical status to a significant degree or contraindicate further dosing. Unacceptable toxicity. Determination by the investigator that it is no longer safe for the participant or in the participant's best interest to continue therapy. Participant request. Severe non-compliance with CSP in the judgement of the investigator and\/or the sponsor.  All protocol deviations must be reported. Clinical need for concomitant or ancillary therapy (ie, non-protocol-specified anticancer therapy) that is not permitted in the study. General or specific changes in the participant's condition that are unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. Participants found to be deriving benefit from treatment and tolerating treatment may continue therapy, subject to agreement between the treating and sponsor physicians.  The participants will be followed according to protocol-defined procedures and assessments.  All protocol deviations will be reviewed, and important protocol deviations will be identified prior to the unblinding of the study. See the SoA (Table 2) for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. All reasons for discontinuation of study treatment must be documented in the eCRF (see Section 7.1.2). 7.1.1  Study Treatment Interruptions If study treatment will be interrupted for a period longer than allowed in the dose modification guidelines (Section 6.6), the investigator will need permission from the sponsor to allow the participant to restart study treatment. 7.1.2  Procedures for Discontinuation of Study Treatment The investigator should instruct the participant to contact the site before or at the time the participant decides to stop the study treatment.  A participant who decides to discontinue study treatment must be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs.  The date of last intake of study treatment should be documented in the eCRF.  All study treatment should be returned by the participant at their next on-site study visit or unscheduled visit.  Participants permanently discontinuing study treatment should be given locally available standard of care therapy, at the discretion of the investigator. Discontinuation of study treatment, for any reason, does not impact on the participant's participation in the study.  The participant should continue attending subsequent study visits and data collection should continue according to the study protocol.  If the participant does not agree to continue in-person study visits, a modified follow-up must be arranged to ensure the collection of endpoints and safety information.  This could be a telephone contact with the participant, a contact with a relative or treating physician, or information from medical records.  The approach taken should be recorded in the medical records.  A participant that agrees to modified follow-up is not considered to have withdrawn consent or to have withdrawn from the study. If either abiraterone or capivasertib\/placebo is discontinued prior to disease progression, participants may remain on the other drug at the investigator's discretion until disease progression or evidence of unacceptable toxicity.  Participants who discontinue one of the study treatments but remain on the other should continue to have assessments performed as outlined in the SoA (Table 2).  Once both capivasertib\/placebo and abiraterone treatment are permanently discontinued, procedures should be followed for the discontinuation and follow up visits.  Participants who have permanently discontinued from further receipt of capivasertib\/placebo and abiraterone will need to be discontinued from the IWRS. 7.2  Participant Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioural, compliance, or administrative reasons.  This is expected to be uncommon. A participant who considers withdrawing from the study must be informed by the investigator about modified follow-up options (eg, telephone contact, a contact with a relative or treating physician, or information from medical records). At the time of withdrawal from the study, if possible, an Early Study Intervention Discontinuation visit should be conducted, as shown in the SoA.  See SoA (Table 2) for data to be collected at the time of study withdrawal and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.  All study treatment should be returned by the participant. The participant will discontinue the study intervention and be withdrawn from the study at that time. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study, it should be confirmed if they still agree for existing samples to be used in line with the original consent.  If the participant requests withdrawal of consent for use of samples, destruction of any samples taken and not tested should be carried in line with what was stated in the informed consent and local regulation.  The investigator must document the decision on use of existing samples in the site study records and inform the Global Study Team. A participant who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs.  The investigator will follow-up participants as medically indicated.  The participant will return electronic PRO (ePRO) devices. AstraZeneca or its delegate will request investigators to make every effort to collect information on participants' survival status (dead or alive; date of death when applicable) at the end of the study, including participants that withdrew consent or are classified as \u2018lost to follow up'.  Survival status can be obtained by site personnel from publicly available resources where it is possible, in accordance with local regulations.  Knowledge of the survival status at study end in all participants is crucial for the integrity of the study. 7.3  Lost to Follow-up A participant will be considered potentially lost to follow-up if they repeatedly fail to return for scheduled visits and are unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and\/or should continue in the study. Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant's last known mailing address or local equivalent methods).  These contact attempts should be documented in the participant's medical record. Efforts to reach the participant should continue until the end of the study.  Should the participant be unreachable at the end of the study, the participant should be considered to be lost to follow-up with unknown vital status at the end of study. Site personnel, or an independent third party, will attempt to collect the vital status of the participant within legal and ethical boundaries for all participants randomised, including those who did not receive investigational product.  Public sources may be searched for vital status information.  If vital status is determined as deceased, this will be documented and the participant will not be considered lost to follow-up.  Sponsor personnel will not be involved in any attempts to collect vital status information. Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole are handled as described in Appendix B 9. 8  STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarised in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria.  The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the participant's routine clinical management (eg, blood count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilised for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA. The investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRFs.  A Web-based Data Capture system will be used for data collection and query handling. The investigator must ensure the accuracy and completeness for eCRFs, which includes legibility and timeliness of the data recorded and of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement.  The investigator will sign the completed eCRFs.  A copy of the completed eCRFs will be archived at the study site. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples. 8.1  Efficacy Assessments 8.1.1  Tumour Assessments Tumour assessments will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and a bone scan for whole body.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before randomisation, and ideally, should be performed as close as possible to randomisation.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) relative to the date of randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), regardless of discontinuation of study treatment (eg, discontinuation due to toxicity or clinical progression) or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy. The assessments by different imaging modalities (eg, CT and bone scintigraphy) can be done on different days but should all be performed within the assessment schedule.  It is important to follow the imaging assessment schedule as closely as possible; however, tumour assessment can be performed at any time when disease progression is clinically suspected.  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged.  If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at the participant's scheduled visits. Participants who discontinue study treatment prior to progression should continue to be scanned until progression.  The same imaging modality and the same assessment (eg, the same contrast protocol for CT scans) should be performed at baseline and at all follow-up time points. Radiological examinations performed during the study should be retained at site as source data. 8.1.2  Evaluation of Disease Progression 8.1.2.1  Radiographic PFS Radiographic PFS is defined as the time from randomisation to: 1) radiographic progression, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), or 2) death due to any cause regardless of whether the participant withdraws from randomised treatment or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression. Radiographic PFS will be measured by investigator assessment, and a sensitivity analysis of PFS assessed by BICR will also be conducted (see Section 8.1.2.4). The definitions of measurable, non-measurable, target and non-target lesions for assessment of soft tissue using RECIST 1.1 criteria, methods of assessment, and the objective tumour response criteria are provided in Appendix E 2.  The PCWG3 guidelines are provided in Appendix E 3. Participants who have not progressed, as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) or PCWG3 criteria (bone), or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 assessment.  However, if the participant progresses or dies immediately after 2 or more consecutive missed visits, the participant will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 bone assessment prior to the 2 missed visits. 8.1.2.2  Evaluation of Soft Tissue Lesions The criteria for objective tumour response on soft tissue lesions will be based on RECIST 1.1: CR (complete response), PR (partial response), SD (stable disease), PD (progressive disease), NE (not evaluable), and NED (no evidence of disease). For participants with measurable lesion at baseline, target lesion progression will be calculated in reference to the smallest tumour burden on study (ie, the smallest sum of diameters previously recorded on study).  In the absence of progression, target lesion response will be calculated using as reference the baseline tumour measurements obtained before starting treatment.  For these participants, the objective tumour response assessment options are CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE. For participants with non-measurable soft tissue lesions only at baseline, the objective tumour response assessment options are CR, PD, Non CR\/Non PD, and NE. For participants with bone lesions only and no soft tissue disease at baseline, the objective tumour response assessment options will be NED, PD (if a new soft tissue lesion appears), or NE (if the scan is not performed). If the investigator is in doubt as to whether disease progression has occurred, particularly with regard to non-target lesions or the appearance of a new lesion, it is advisable to continue treatment and reassess the tumour burden at the next scheduled assessment or sooner if clinically indicated.  If repeat scans confirm progression, then the date of the initial scan should be declared as the date of progression.  New bone lesions should not be counted in the RECIST assessment. To achieve \u2018unequivocal progression' on the basis of non-target lesions, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest \u2018increase' in the size of 1 or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. 8.1.2.3  Evaluation of Bone Lesions Progression on a bone scan is identified using PCWG3 criteria, by having 2 or more new metastatic bone lesions. For participants without progression at the first visit after baseline, the scan from this first visit after baseline now serves as new reference for all subsequent scans, ie, assuming all visits are acquired according to schedule, all bone scans after Week 16 are compared to the Week 16 scan. The requirements for determination of radiographic progression by either bone scan (bone progression) or CT\/MRI (soft tissue progression) are summarised in Table 6. Table 6  Requirements for Documentation of Radiographic Progression Visit Date  Visit Date   None Criteria for Bone Progression  Criteria for Bone Progression Criteria for Soft Tissue Progression  Criteria for Soft Tissue Progression First tumour assessment after baseline  First tumour assessment after baseline \u2022  \u2022 \u2022  \u2022 2 or more new lesions compared to baseline bone scan, and  2 or more new lesions compared to baseline bone scan, and Confirmed by an additional 2 or more new lesions compared to the first post-baseline bone scan at least  Confirmed by an additional 2 or more new lesions compared to the first post-baseline bone scan at least 6 weeks later  6 weeks later Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1  Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1 No confirmation required  No confirmation required From the second tumour assessment after baseline  From the second tumour assessment after baseline \u2022  \u2022 \u2022  \u2022 2 or more new lesions compared to the first bone scan after baseline No confirmation required  2 or more new lesions compared to the first bone scan after baseline No confirmation required Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1  Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1 No confirmation required  No confirmation required Visit Date None Criteria for Bone Progression Criteria for Soft Tissue Progression First tumour assessment after baseline \u2022 \u2022 2 or more new lesions compared to baseline bone scan, and Confirmed by an additional 2 or more new lesions compared to the first post-baseline bone scan at least 6 weeks later Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1 No confirmation required From the second tumour assessment after baseline \u2022 \u2022 2 or more new lesions compared to the first bone scan after baseline No confirmation required Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1 No confirmation required CT Computed tomography; MRI Magnetic resonance imaging; RECIST Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. 8.1.2.4  Central Reading of Scans A BICR of the scans will be conducted and the results used in a sensitivity analysis of rPFS. Images, including unscheduled visit scans, will be collected on an ongoing basis and sent to an AstraZeneca-appointed imaging Contract Research Organisation (iCRO) for QC, storage, and for BICR.  Digital copies of all original scans should be stored at the investigator site as source documents.  Electronic image transfer from the sites to the iCRO is strongly encouraged.  A BICR of images will be performed at the discretion of AstraZeneca.  Results of these independent reviews will not be communicated to investigators, and results of investigator tumour assessments will not be shared with the central reviewers.  The management of participants will be based solely upon the results of the RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and PCWG3 (bone) assessment conducted by the investigator. All treatment decisions will be based on site assessment of scans.  After the primary rPFS analysis, central review of scans will no longer be required, and investigators will be advised when to stop sending copies of the scans to the CRO conducting the central review. 8.1.2.5  PFS2 PFS2 is defined as the time from randomisation until progression on next-line treatment (ie, the line of treatment following the first progression in the study), as clinical progression, PSA progression, or radiographic progression determined by RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone) as assessed by the investigator, or death due to any cause.  Censoring details will be defined in the SAP. A participant will enter the PFS2 follow-up period once that participant has discontinued study treatment due to progressive disease by RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue lesions and\/or PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions. The participant's status at first progression will be used as the reference for assessment of PFS2. RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 assessments will not be collected for assessment of PFS2. The date of PFS2 assessment and the investigator's opinion of progression status (progressed or non-progressed) at each assessment will be recorded in the eCRF.  Determination of progressive disease for PFS2 will be by institutional call. 8.1.3  Overall Survival Overall survival is the length of time from randomisation until the date of death due to any cause.  In the survival follow-up period, all subsequent cancer therapies and vital status will be documented at least every 12 weeks until death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first. Any participant not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the participant was known to be alive. Survival information may be obtained via telephone contact with the participant, participant's family, by contact with the participant's current physician, or local death registries as described in Section 7.3. Survival calls will be made in the week following the date of DCO for each of the rPFS or OS analyses.  If participants are confirmed to be alive or if the death date is after the DCO date, these participants will be censored at the date of DCO. 8.1.4  Time to PSA Progression Time to PSA progression is defined as the time from randomisation to PSA progression, as determined by PCWG3 criteria: PSA progression is the date that an increase of 25% or more and absolute increase of 2 ng\/mL or more from the nadir are documented, which is confirmed by a second value obtained 3 or more weeks later.  Censoring details for this endpoint will be defined in the SAP. Blood samples for PSA measurements will be collected and evaluated by the local testing laboratory at timelines as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  These assessments should continue until disease progression, regardless of discontinuation of study treatment. 8.1.5  Time to First Subsequent Therapy Time to First Subsequent Therapy (TFST) is defined as time from randomisation to the earlier of start date of the first subsequent anticancer therapy after discontinuation of randomised treatment, or death due to any cause. All anticancer treatments (including, but not limited to, chemotherapy and targeted agents), and the investigator's opinion of response to these treatments plus the date of progression, following discontinuation of study treatment, must be recorded.  Subsequent systemic anticancer therapies (excluding radiotherapy) will be reviewed prior to data unblinding to assess which represent clinically important treatments intended to control prostate cancer.  Any participant not known to have died at the time of the analysis and not known to have had a further anticancer therapy will be censored at the last known time to have not received subsequent therapy, ie, the last follow-up visit where this was confirmed. 8.1.6  SSE-FS Symptomatic skeletal event-free survival (SSE-FS) is defined as the time from randomisation until any of the following (or death due to any cause): Use of radiation therapy to prevent or relieve skeletal symptoms. Occurrence of new symptomatic pathological bone fractures (vertebral or non-vertebral).  Radiologic documentation is required.  A pathological fracture, as determined by investigator, is defined as associated with low or no trauma and deemed to have occurred at a site of bone metastasis. Occurrence of spinal cord compression.  Radiologic documentation is required. Orthopaedic surgical intervention for bone metastasis. Participants who have not experienced any of the above conditions will be censored at the time of the last SSE assessment. Assessments for symptomatic skeletal events will be performed at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 1.3), and should continue beyond disease progression, regardless of discontinuation of study treatment. 8.1.7  Time to Castration Resistance Time to castration resistance (TTCR) is defined as the time from randomisation to the first castration-resistant event (radiographic disease progression, PSA progression, or SSE), whichever occurs first, at castrate levels of testosterone (below 50 ng\/dL).  Censoring details will be defined in the SAP. The timepoints of assessments for radiographic progression and SSEs, and collection of samples for determination of PSA and serum testosterone levels are indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3). 8.1.8  Patient-reported Outcomes A clinical outcome assessment (COA) is an assessment of a clinical outcome reported by a clinician, a patient, or a non-clinician observer, or through a performance-based assessment (FDA-NIH BEST Resource).  A COA may be used in clinical studies to provide either direct or indirect evidence of treatment benefit.  It is important to examine the impact of therapy on disease-related symptoms, physical function, and other HRQoL of the patient to aid understanding of how clinical benefit relates to patient well-being and for consideration in making risk-benefit evaluations.  PRO is one type of clinical outcome assessment and is a general term referring to all outcomes and symptoms that are directly reported by the patient.  Moreover, PROs assist in the documentation of symptoms and specifically what symptoms and impacts are most important to patients and how these relate to clinical outcomes.  PROs have become important in evaluating effectiveness of study treatments in clinical studies and will aid in understanding of the benefit\/risk evaluation (Kluetz et al 2018).  The following PROs will be administered in this study: BPI-SF, BFI, FACT-P, PGIS, EQ-5D-5L, and selected questions from the PRO-CTCAE items library.  Samples of the PRO questionnaires are provided in Appendix F.  PROs will be administered according to the SoA (Section 1.3).  PROs will be provided in the native language(s) of the country in which they will be administered, except for PRO-CTCAE, which will only be administered in the languages where a linguistically validated version is available. 8.1.8.1  BPI-SF The BPI-SF (Appendix F 1) is a validated, 15-item domain-specific instrument designed to assess the severity of pain and the impact\/interference of pain on daily functions (Cleeland and Ryan 1994).  The BPI-SF will be scored according to the user guide (Cleeland 2009).  All BPI-SF pain items including \u2018worst pain' is scored on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS) with 0 = No Pain and 10 = Worst Pain Imaginable.  This instrument consists of 2 domains: pain severity and pain interference.  The pain severity domain consists of 4 items (Item 3, Item 4, Item 5, and Item 6) which assess pain at its \u2018worst,' \u2018least,' \u2018average,' and \u2018now' (current pain) respectively on the 11-point NRS.  These 4 items may be averaged as a composite pain severity score or they may be interpreted individually (Dworkin et al 2005, Dworkin et al 2008, FDA 2009, Turk et al 2006).  In this study, the \u2018worst pain' (Item 3) will be used as a single item in assessing pain progression.  A composite pain severity score from all the 4 items will also be evaluated.  A 2- or more point change in the \u2018worst pain' item is considered clinically meaningful. The pain interference domain score is a mean of 7 items: general activity (Item 9A), mood (Item 9B), walking ability (Item 9C), normal work (Item 9D), relations with other people (Item 9E), sleep (Item 9F), and enjoyment of life (Item 9G), each scored on an 11-point NRS from 0 (Does not interfere) to 10 (Completely interferes).  Based on the BPI-SF scoring manual, the following items are not used in scoring pain severity or pain interference domains: Items 1, 2, 7, and 8.  Item 7 (a free text field) describing pain medication use is captured separately in more detail using the analgesic log. The BPI-SF analgesic log (captured on ePRO device) will be completed by the participant as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Further details on the analgesic log and scoring are provided in Sections 8.1.8.8 and 8.1.8.9, respectively. Time to pain progression is a key secondary endpoint of this study (see Section 8.1.8.2).  In addition, change from baseline in pain severity and pain interference domain scores may be derived. 8.1.8.2  Time to Pain Progression The key secondary endpoint of TTPP is defined as the time from randomisation to the time point at which clinically meaningful pain progression is observed, based on a 2-point increase from baseline in the BPI-SF Item 3 \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' score and\/or initiation of\/increase in opiate analgesic use.  A minimum of 4 days of data is required.  The criteria for pain progression depend on whether a participant is asymptomatic or symptomatic at baseline: Asymptomatic participants at baseline (average BPI-SF Item 3 score of 0 and not taking opioids) Increase of 2 or more points in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' (BPI-SF Item 3) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks) OR Initiation of opioid use for pain Symptomatic participants at baseline (average BPI-SF Item 3 score > 0 and\/or currently taking opioids) Increase of 2 or more points in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' (BPI-SF Item 3) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks) and an average worst pain score \u2265 4, and no decrease in average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or more points decrease in AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher OR Increase in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or more points increase (or at least 2 points increase if the starting value is 0) in the AQA score from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks). Participants satisfying one or more of the criteria above will be considered to have pain progression.  Participants who do not satisfy any of the criteria above will be censored at the time of the last known assessment that showed an absence of pain progression. Censoring A number of situations will lead to a participant's time to pain progression being censored; these are as follows: If a participant meets the criteria for pain progression after 2 or more missed visits (visits which showed < 4 days of BPI-SF worst pain [Item 3] assessments and the average AQA score does not meet the progression criteria), then the participant will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used). Participants who have not met the criteria for pain progression at the time of analysis: The censoring date will be the date of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used). Participants with no evaluable baseline or post-baseline data will be censored at Day 1. For participants who receive subsequent anticancer therapy: The censoring date will be the date of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment prior to the start date of subsequent anticancer therapy (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used) Participants with no evaluable baseline or post-baseline data will be censored at Day 1. 8.1.8.3  Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) The BFI (Appendix F 2) is a self-administered instrument developed to assess the severity of fatigue and the impact of fatigue on functioning (Mendoza et al 1999).  It includes 9 items which measure fatigue severity (3 items) and fatigue interference (6 items).  The first 3 items (Item 1, Item 2, and Item 3) ask participants about their: level of fatigue right now, usual level of fatigue within the past 24 hours, and fatigue at its worst level within the past 24 hours on an 11-point NRS of 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine).  The 6 fatigue interference items (Item 4A, Item 4B, Item 4C, Item 4D, Item 4E, and Item 4F, respectively) evaluate participants on the extent to which fatigue interfered with their daily activities (ie, general activity, mood, walking, work, relationships, and enjoyment of life) on an 11-point NRS of 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).  While not developed specifically for prostate cancer or mHSPC, its reliability and clinical and concurrent validity have been demonstrated in cancer more generally (Mendoza et al 1999, Whitehead 2009).  It has also been used to measure fatigue in one mHSPC study (LATITUDE, Fizazi et al 2019) and one mCRPC study (COU-AA-301, Sternberg et al 2013), respectively.  The items\/scales used to measure fatigue in LATITUDE are not specified.  In COU-AA-301, fatigue was measured via \u2018fatigue intensity', defined as the score of the worst fatigue item (Item 3), and \u2018fatigue interference', defined as the average score of all the interference items (Items 4A - 4F).  A clinically important difference in \u2018fatigue intensity' was defined in this study as a change in \u2265 2 points from baseline, while a change in \u2265 1.25 points from baseline for \u2018fatigue interference' was considered clinically meaningful (Sternberg et al 2013).  These clinically important thresholds will be used in the current study. In this study, the \u2018worst fatigue' (Item 3) will be used as a single item in assessing deterioration in \u2018fatigue intensity'.  Also, a composite or mean score of 3 items (Items 1-3) will be evaluated as \u2018fatigue severity'.  Finally, a \u2018fatigue interference' domain score will be based on a mean of the 6 interference items (Items 4A-4F). The following may be derived as secondary endpoints: Time to deterioration in fatigue intensity (defined as a change \u2265 2 points from baseline in worst fatigue item [Item 3] score). Time to deterioration in fatigue interference (defined as a change \u2265 1.25 points from baseline in fatigue interference domain score). Change from baseline in fatigue severity and fatigue interference domain scores. 8.1.8.4  FACT-P The FACT-P (Appendix F 3) is a disease-specific 39-item questionnaire included for the purpose of assessing HRQoL and prostate cancer-specific symptoms.  It is a well-established measure of HRQoL\/health status commonly used in prostate cancer studies.  The FACT-P was developed specifically for patients with advanced prostate cancer and has been found to be reliable and valid in this population (Esper et al 1997).  The FACT-P consists of 5 subscales: Physical Well-Being (PWB; 7 items), Functional Well-Being (FWB; 7 items), Emotional Well-Being (EWB; 6 items), Social Well-Being (SWB; 7 items), and Additional Concerns or Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS) specific to prostate cancer (12 items).  All FACT-P questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4 (0 being not at all and 4 being very much).  Negatively stated items are reversed by subtracting the response from 4.  For all subscales, symptoms index, and individual item scores, the higher the score, the better the HRQoL\/symptom.  In addition to the Total and Subscale scores, the FACT-P also supports the calculation of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) total score (sum of PWB, SWB, EWB, and FWB scores), a Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score (the sum of the PWB, FWB, and PCS scores), and the FACT Advanced Prostate Symptom Index-6 (FAPSI-6), a symptom score made up of 6 items from within the FACT-P (3 pain items, 1 fatigue item, 1 weight loss item, and 1 condition getting worse item). The following may be derived as other secondary endpoints: Time to deterioration in FACT-P scores (FACT-P total score, FACT-G total score, TOI, functional well-being, physical well-being, prostate cancer subscale, and FAPSI-6, respectively). Change from baseline in FACT-P scores (FACT-P total score, FACT-G total score, TOI, functional well-being, physical well-being, prostate cancer subscale, and FAPSI-6, respectively). 8.1.8.5  PRO-CTCAE The PRO-CTCAE (Appendix F 5) will only be administered where a linguistically validated version exists for a country. PRO-CTCAE was developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and is included to address tolerability from the patients' perspective.  PRO-CTCAE is an item library of symptoms experienced by patients while undergoing treatment of their cancer.  It was developed in recognition that collecting treatment-related symptom data directly from patients using PRO tools can improve the accuracy and efficiency of symptomatic AE data collection.  This was based on findings from multiple studies demonstrating that physicians and nurses underestimate symptom onset, frequency, and severity in comparison with patient ratings (Basch et al 2009, Litwin et al 1998, Sprangers and Aaronson 1992).  To date, 78 symptoms of the CTCAE have been identified to be amenable to patient reporting.  These symptoms have been converted to patient terms (eg, CTCAE term \u2018myalgia' converted to \u2018aching muscles').  The items included in the PRO-CTCAE have undergone extensive qualitative review among experts and patients.  Using cognitive testing methods, these items and the additional questions for some of the symptoms have been extensively evaluated by cancer patients, so that symptoms of interest are clear, comprehendible, and measurable.  Not all items are administered in any one clinical study.  The intention is to only ask participants to complete those items considered relevant for the study, site of cancer, and cancer treatment.  Participants on all study arms will complete the same selection of symptom items for the PRO-CTCAE.  Several decision rules were applied to the selection to achieve an unbiased selection and reasonable patient completion time.  Safety data for capivasertib, abiraterone acetate, and hormonal treatments (administered in both arms of the study) informed the symptom selection.  Safety and AE data for capivasertib was accessed via the most recent IB, while the US Package Inserts were used to assess the abiraterone and ADT.  Symptomatic AEs from the PRO-CTCAE items library that are considered relevant based on the reported safety and AEs for capivasertib, abiraterone, and hormonal treatments were selected for this study (see Appendix F 5). The Free Text item in the PRO-CTCAE instrument is not included in this study, as the utility of this information and the analysis method have not been established.  The full list of items is available in Appendix F 5. 8.1.8.6  PGIS The impact of treatment on the overall severity of cancer symptoms over the past week will be assessed using the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) single-item questionnaire (Appendix F 4).  PGIS is useful for determining the responder threshold of other PRO measures. 8.1.8.7  EQ-5D-5L The EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal (EuroQol Group 1990).  Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in population health surveys.  The questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions as follows: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain\/discomfort, and anxiety\/depression.  Each dimension has 5 response options (\u2018no problems', \u2018slight problems', \u2018moderate problems', \u2018severe problems', and \u2018extreme problems') that reflect increasing levels of difficulty (EuroQol Group 2013). Previous versions of EQ-5D had only 3 levels of difficulty, EQ-5D-3L.  Since 2009, the EuroQol Group developed a more sensitive version of the EQ-5D (the EQ-5D-5L) that expands the range of responses to each dimension from 3 to 5 levels of increasing severity (Herdman et al 2011).  Preliminary studies indicate that the 5L version improves upon the properties of the 3L measure in terms of reduced ceiling effect, increased reliability, and an improved ability to differentiate between different levels of health (Janssen et al 2008a, Janssen et al 2008b, Pickard et al 2007).  A sample of the EQ-5D-5L is provided in Appendix F 6. The participant will be asked to indicate their current health state by selecting the most appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensions.  The questionnaire also includes a visual analog scale, where the participant will be asked to rate current health status on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst imaginable health state. 8.1.8.8  Analgesic Log The analgesic log will be implemented using the ERT Medication Module\u2122, a component of the ERT eCOA System that serves for accurately tracking subject consumption of concomitant and\/or rescue medications.  The Medication Module allows medication data capture via the ERT eCOA Universal App, followed by the review and management of that data by sites and sponsors.  The Medication Module provides a consistent, easier-to-use and more efficient tool compared with paper-based reporting.  Using the module, participants will record all analgesic medication dosages and dosage times to track pain medications use.  The Medication Module includes the following components: Global Master Medication List: This list will be developed collaboratively by ERT and AstraZeneca and will contain all approved analgesic drug names including generic names and formulations.  The list will be updated over the course of the study via an approval workflow process, when necessary. eCOA Universal App Medication Diary: The medication diary will allow participants to log analgesic medication intake during scheduled assessments.  Study sites will check and update the medication diary for participants as needed throughout the study. Medication Report: This may be used to remotely update the tailored list of medications available on a participant's eCOA Universal App. The analgesic log is study specific (not generic) and screenshots will be available and submitted along with the CSP to IRB\/IECs. Although information on all analgesics used by participants in pain control will be collected using the analgesic log, only changes in opiate are considered in pain progression evaluation in line with FDA recommendation.  Opiates consumed by participants will be converted into oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) as defined in Chung et al 2014.  The analgesic quantification algorithm (AQA) developed by Chung et al 2014 will be used to quantify and score analgesic use in the study.  The AQA is an 8-point scale that assigns a score as follows: 0 = No analgesic 1 = Non-opioid analgesics 2 = Weak opioids (eg, codeine, tramadol) 3 = Strong opioids \u2264 75 mg OME per day 4 = Strong opioids > 75 to 150 mg OME per day 5 = Strong opioids > 150 to 300 mg OME per day 6 = Strong opioids > 300 to 600 mg OME per day 7 = Strong opioids > 600 mg OME per day 8.1.8.9  Analgesic Use Scoring Opiate analgesic use (AQA score) will be assessed at timelines specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  The average daily OME will require at least 4 days of data and will be used to assign the AQA score.  An increase of 1 point or more in the AQA score from a starting value of 1 or higher OR \u2265 2 points in AQA score from a starting value of 0 is considered a clinically meaningful increase in opiate use.  Similarly, a decrease of 1 point or more in the AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher is considered a clinically meaningful decrease in opiate use. 8.1.8.10  Administration of PRO Questionnaires The PRO instruments will be self-administered at home by the participants using handheld devices at the time points indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Participants may complete the ePROs at study sites if the assessment time point coincides with a scheduled site visit; otherwise, participants may complete the ePROs at home.  The analgesic use log using the ERT Medication Module\u2122 will also be administered electronically alongside the ePROs.  If there is a technical issue with the device, the site will have access to a web-based back up. Each site must allocate the responsibility for the administration of the ePRO instruments to a specific individual (eg, a research nurse or study coordinator) and, if possible, assign a backup person to cover if that individual is absent. Approximately 15 to 30 minutes is required for participants to complete the questionnaires. The below instructions should be followed when collecting PRO data via an electronic device: PRO questionnaires completed at site visits must be completed prior to treatment administration and ideally before any discussions of health status to avoid biasing the participant's responses to the questions.  As feasible, site staff should also ensure PRO questionnaires are completed prior to other study procedures, such as collection of laboratory samples, to further minimise bias. When each instrument is due to be completed, the following order will be observed: BPI-SF, BFI, Analgesic Log, FACT-P, PGIS, EQ-5D-5L, and then PRO-CTCAE. PRO questionnaires should be completed by the participant in a quiet and private location. The participant should be given sufficient time to complete the questionnaires at their own speed. The research nurse or appointed site staff must explain to participants the value and relevance of ePRO participation, so they are motivated to comply with questionnaire completion.  Inform the participant that these questions are being asked to find out, directly from them, how they feel. The research nurse or appointed site staff should stress that the information is not routinely shared with study staff. Therefore, if the participant has any medical problems, they should discuss them with the doctor or research nurse separately from the ePRO assessment. The research nurse or appointed site staff must train the participant on how to use the PRO device, using the materials and training provided by the ePRO vendor. The research nurse or appointed site staff must provide guidance on whom to call if there are problems with the device if the participant is completing the ePRO at home. All questionnaires must be completed using the ePRO device; paper questionnaires are not allowed in this study. The research nurse or appointed site staff must remind participants there are no right or wrong answers and avoid introducing bias by not clarifying items for the participant. The participant should not receive help from relatives, friends, or clinic staff to respond to the ePRO questionnaires.  The responses are the participant's alone. On completion of the questionnaire at the site, the device should be handed back to the designated responsible person, who should check that all questionnaires were completed. If a participant uses visual aids (eg, spectacles or contact lenses) for reading and does not have them when he or she attends the clinic, the participant will be exempted from completing the ePROs at that clinic visit, though they can complete them at home if within the allowable window. Site staff must not read or complete the ePRO questionnaires on behalf of the participant.  If the participant is unable to read the questionnaire (eg, is blind or illiterate), that participant is exempted from completing PRO questionnaires but may still participate in the study.  If the participant cannot complete the ePRO questionnaires due to other than being blind or illiterate, the AstraZeneca study team must be contacted to determine if they can be exempted.  This includes requirements for screening questionnaires.  Participants exempted in this regard should be flagged appropriately by the site staff in the source documents and in the Review of PRO\/Questionnaire\/Diary (REVPRDI) eCRF. Site staff must administer questionnaires available in the language that the participant speaks and understands.  Questions should not be read in an available language and translated into another language for the participant. It is vital that the ePRO reporting is conducted at the Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1 visit, as specified in the SoA.  The participant should bring the device to every site visit so the site can confirm the device is functioning properly.  It is especially critical the participant bring the device to the Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1 visit so not to miss the assessments that have baseline at this visit.  The ePRO device must be charged and fully functional at the beginning of the baseline visit to ensure that the PROs can be completed at the start of the visit. Finally, the research nurse or appointed site staff will review the completion status of questionnaires during site visits and document the reason(s) why a participant could not complete assessments either in the REVPRDI eCRF or the device depending on the set-up for the study. Reminders should be sent to the participant at home as needed to ensure compliance with the assessment schedules.  The research nurse or appointed site staff must monitor compliance, since minimising missing data is a key aspect of study success.  It is important that the PRO device is charged and fully functional.  Compliance must be checked at each study visit and should be checked more frequently to identify problems early.  If compliance drops below 88%, they will be flagged in the routine compliance report generated by the ePRO system, and a check-in call from the study site to ask the participant if he or she has any difficulties is highly recommended.  A solution to enhance\/resolve compliance should be discussed with the participant.  Discussions and compliance review should be reflected in source documents. 8.1.8.11  Unify Mobile Software Application The electronic device containing the PRO instruments will also contain a Unify mobile software application.  The Unify mobile software application, and associated website system, will provide digital support to patients from screening through to, and including, follow-up.  The system will provide patients and site study staff with information and tools relevant to the conduct of the study in accordance with this CSP.  This will comprise treatment medication reminders, clinical visit reminders, and educational content relating to the disease and medication. 8.2  Safety Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Section 1.3). 8.2.1  Physical Examinations The physical examination will be performed at timelines as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3) and will include an assessment of the following: general appearance, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdomen skin, head and neck (including ears, eyes, nose and throat), lymph nodes, thyroid, musculoskeletal (including spine and extremities) and neurological systems. Weight and height will be assessed at timelines as specified in the SoA. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses, new or worsening abnormalities may qualify as AEs. 8.2.2  Vital Signs Vital signs (including blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature) will be assessed at timelines as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed with a completely automated device.  Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones). Vital signs will be measured in a supine position after 10 minutes rest and will include temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse.  Three readings of blood pressure and pulse will be taken and should be reported in the participant's notes.  The first reading should be rejected.  The second and third readings should be averaged to give the measurement to be recorded in the eCRF. 8.2.3  Electrocardiograms Triplicate 12-lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (Section 1.3). All ECGs to be conducted as triplicate measurements, within approximately 5 minutes of starting (the 3 ECGs separated by approximately 2 minutes).  Assessments should be performed as close as possible to, but within 30 minutes of the nominal time point. The timing and number of ECGs may be altered depending on the emerging PK and safety profile.  Additional ECGs may be taken at the discretion of the investigator. Twelve-lead ECGs will be obtained after the participant has been resting semi-supine for at least 10 minutes prior to the times indicated.  All ECGs should be recorded with the participant in the same physical position.  A standardised ECG machine should be used and the participant should be examined using the same machine throughout the study if possible. After paper ECGs have been recorded, the investigator or designated physician will review each of the ECGs and may refer to a local cardiologist if appropriate.  A paper copy should be filed in the participant's medical records. If an abnormal ECG finding at screening or baseline is considered clinically significant by the investigator, it should be reported as a concurrent condition.  For all ECGs, details of intervals PR, R-R, QRS, QT, and QTcF and an overall evaluation will be recorded (normal; abnormal, non-clinically significant or abnormal, clinically significant). 8.2.4  Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis will be taken at the visits indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3). Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator.  The date, time of collection and results (values, units, and reference ranges) will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. The clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis will be performed at a local laboratory at or near to the investigator site.  Sample tubes and sample sizes may vary depending on laboratory method used and routine practice at the site. Laboratory values that meet the criteria for CTCAE grade 3 or have changed significantly from baseline and are considered to be of clinical concern will be repeated\/confirmed within 7 days and followed up as appropriate. The investigator should assess the available results with regard to clinically relevant abnormalities.  The laboratory results should be signed and dated and retained at centre as source data for laboratory variables.  For information on how AEs based on laboratory tests should be recorded and reported, see Section 8.3.6. Table 7 lists the clinical safety laboratory variables to be measured.

Actions required in cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy's Law', for further instructions.  ALT Alanine aminotransferase; AST Aspartate aminotransferase; B Blood; P Plasma; S Serum; TSH Thyroid-stimulating hormone; U Urine. 8.2.4.1  Glucose and Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c) Blood glucose and HbA1c will be assessed according to the SoA (Section 1.3).  On blood glucose assessment days (incorporating clinical chemistry and glucose) it is requested that participants refrain from caloric intake for \u2265 4 hours prior to the morning dose of study treatment. Glucose (fasting) is to be measured at screening, pre-dose; at 1 hour and 4 hours post-dose in Cycle 1, Day 1; pre-dose on Cycle 1, Day 15; pre-dose in Cycle 2, Day 1; and at discontinuation of study treatment. Further glucose monitoring may be performed at the investigator's discretion in Cycles 1 and 2 based on the participant's characteristics (ie, diabetes or high risk of hyperglycaemia), and in Cycle 3 onwards based on results during Cycles 1 and 2. HbA1c is to be measured at screening, every 16 weeks from Cycle 1, Day 1, and at discontinuation of study treatment. Note: in addition to the fasted glucose assessments identified in the SoA (Section 1.3), random glucose measurements are to be performed (and recorded) as part of the standard clinical chemistry assessments throughout the study. 8.2.4.2  Serum Creatinine After Cycle 2 onwards, participants taking capivasertib\/placebo and metformin in combination should have creatinine assessments conducted as part of the routine clinical chemistry with additional monitoring of creatinine at the discretion of the investigator. 8.2.5  MUGA Scan\/Echocardiogram Assessments will be performed at screening and thereafter as clinically indicated.  Bidimensional echocardiography (Echo) is the preferred modality because of the global technetium [Tc-99m] shortage (but MUGA can be used alternatively). The modality of the cardiac function assessments must be consistent within participant, ie, if echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment and a follow-up assessment if clinically indicated, then echocardiogram should also be used for subsequent scans if required.  The participant should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible. 8.3  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The Principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix H. AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorised representative). The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE.  For information on how to follow up AEs see Section 8.3.2. 8.3.1  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information Adverse events, including SAEs, will be collected from time of signature of the ICF, throughout the treatment period and including the 30-day follow-up period after discontinuation of study drug.  * *In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs\/SAEs must be reported. If the investigator becomes aware of a SAE with a suspected causal relationship to the IMP that occurs after the end of the clinical study in a participant treated by him or her, the investigator shall, without undue delay, report the SAE to the sponsor. 8.3.2  Follow-up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE\/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits\/contacts.  All SAEs\/non-serious AEs (as defined in Appendix H), will be followed until resolution, stabilisation, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up. A post-study assessment will be performed preferably within 7 days of the time that the IMP is permanently discontinued. Safety follow-up should be carried out with the participant 30 days (+ 7 days) after the discontinuation of study treatment to follow-up any SAEs\/AEs and concomitant medications (including any subsequent cancer therapy). Any AE\/SAE\/abnormal laboratory findings that are ongoing at the time of study treatment discontinuation or any new treatment related events within 30 days of study treatment, must be followed up to resolution or until the event becomes stable (or returns to baseline) or is unlikely to resolve further in the opinion of the investigator. Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant's last AE assessment or other assessment\/visit as appropriate in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF.  AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any participant with ongoing AE(s)\/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 8.3.3  Adverse Event Variables The following variables will be collected for each AE: AE (verbatim) The date when the AE started and stopped CTCAE grade and changes in CTCAE grade Whether the AE is serious or not Investigator causality rating against the IMP(s) (yes or no) Action taken with regard to IMP(s) AE caused participant's withdrawal from study (yes or no) Outcome. In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: Date AE met criteria for serious AE Date investigator became aware of SAE AE is serious due to Date of hospitalisation Date of discharge Probable cause of death Date of death Autopsy performed Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) Causality assessment to other medication 8.3.4  Causality Collection The investigator should assess the causal relationship between the IMP and each AE, and answer \u2018yes' or \u2018no' to the question \u2018Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?' For SAEs, causal relationship should also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as \u2018yes'. A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix H. 8.3.5  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the participant or reported in response to the open question from the study site staff (eg, \u2018Have you had any health problems since the previous visit\/you were last asked?'), or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF.  When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 8.3.6  Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests The results from the CSP-mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG abnormalities should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria, are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product or are considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the investigator (which may include but not limited to consideration as to whether treatment or non-planned visits were required or other action was taken with the study treatment, eg, dose adjustment or drug interruption). If deterioration in a laboratory value\/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result\/vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE\/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally related to the disease under study (see Section 8.3.8). 8.3.7  Hy's Law Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT \u2265 3xULN together with total bilirubin \u2265 2xULN may need to be reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix G for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy's Law. 8.3.8  Disease Progression Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a participant's condition attributable to the disease for which the investigational product is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and\/or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The development of new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events that are unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an AE during the study. 8.3.9  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational product, or to the study procedure(s)*.  All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. *In Screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting). If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately.  investigators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the EDC system, an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the EDC system is not available, then the investigator or other study site staff reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the investigator\/study site staff how to proceed. For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix H. The reference document for definition of expectedness\/listedness for capivasertib is the current IB; for abiraterone, the local prescribing information is the reference document for definition of expectedness\/listedness. 8.3.10  Pregnancy Paternal Exposure Participants should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 16 weeks following the last dose of capivasertib\/placebo. Pregnancy of the participants' partners is not considered to be an AE.

In participants who are diabetic, it may be beneficial to rule out concomitant aetiologies that could be associated with hyperglycaemia (eg, infections, dehydration, vascular events, glucocorticoids). Participants should be made aware of symptoms of hyperglycaemia (eg, polydipsia and polyuria). Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related hyperglycaemia are shown in Table 9.  In addition, for all grades, participants may receive education on lifestyle changes (eg, a diabetic diet) and consider beginning home glucose monitoring (eg, fasting self-blood glucose monitoring once daily) at the discretion of the investigator.  If glucose home monitoring is instituted, the capivasertib\/placebo treatment decision should be based on the morning fasting glucose value obtained prior to the dose of capivasertib\/placebo. It is recommended that approaches to the management of capivasertib-induced hyperglycaemia include advice from a diabetologist where appropriate (eg, participants with diabetes).  Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies (see below for further guidance).  If a second agent is required, consideration should be given to the intermittent schedule of capivasertib and the pattern of glucose changes (eg, sulphonylureas should be avoided due to the risk of hypoglycaemia secondary to their mechanism of action).

Use of metformin Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies.  Investigators should exercise caution in the dosing and management of participants receiving the metformin and capivasertib\/placebo combination and must be vigilant for signs of renal impairment and metformin toxicity, such as lactic acidosis and hypoglycaemia, namely: lethargy, hypotension, poor urine output, drowsiness, irritation, tachypnoea, sweating, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Due to the potential interaction of metformin and capivasertib (caused by the inhibition of renal transporters [eg, OCT2] involved in the excretion of metformin), when taking both capivasertib and metformin concurrently, participants should attend the clinic for monitoring of serum creatinine at least once per week for the first 3 weeks after initiation of metformin, then every 3 weeks thereafter. Metformin should only be given on the days when capivasertib\/placebo is also administered (the half-life of capivasertib is approximately 7 to 15 hours) and should be withdrawn when treatment with capivasertib\/placebo is withdrawn, unless otherwise clinically indicated. Consider withholding of metformin on the days when participants are due to have imaging with contrast (in order to reduce the already low risk of lactic acidosis) as per local guidelines. Maculo-papular Rash Dose modifications for capivasertib-related maculo-papular rash, which is the most frequent skin toxicity observed in participants treated with capivasertib, are provided in Table 10.  However, these management guidelines can be used for other skin toxicities at the discretion of the investigator and\/or following consultation with the dermatologist.

BSA, body surface area; NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. Hypersensitivity In the case of hypersensitivity reactions, capivasertib\/placebo should be discontinued, and symptomatic\/supportive therapy should be initiated (including with antihistamines and\/or steroids) as considered appropriate by the investigator\/treating physician.  Drug re-challenge is not recommended; any subsequent consideration on re-challenge with capivasertib at the same or a lower dose, with its potential for recurrence of such or more severe events should be carefully considered against the potential benefits to the individual participant from continuation of capivasertib therapy and agreed with the sponsor.  Further management should follow local guidelines on management of hypersensitivity reactions. Diarrhoea Participants should be instructed to promptly contact investigators if they develop diarrhoea. Alternative aetiologies should be ruled out prior to initiating the dose modifications.  Investigators are recommended to prescribe anti-diarrhoeal treatment at the first visit so that participants can start treatment at the first sign of diarrhoea, should it occur.  Loperamide is the preferred anti-diarrhoeal agent for the management of diarrhoea occurring in participants participating in studies of capivasertib.  If diarrhoea is reported, additional details regarding this AE will be collected in the eCRF. Dose modifications for capivasertib-related diarrhoea are provided in Table 11.

Samples for biomarker research are required and will be collected from all participants in this study as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). Mandatory Tumour Samples Tumour tissue samples from either the primary or metastatic sites (excluding bone metastases and FNA samples), taken as part of routine clinical practice, will be provided for assessment of PTEN status by IHC.  Determination of PTEN status is a requirement for recruitment and only patients with PTEN deficiency as detected by central testing using the Investigational Use Only (IUO) PTEN IHC assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, USA) will be enrolled.  This sample needs to be provided for screening Part 1, and should preferably be a representative FFPE tissue block, that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides, or if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides from the most recently collected tumour tissue.  Further details on tissue specifications are outlined in the Laboratory Manual and the Pathology Testing Manual.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1. In addition to being used for determination of eligibility for this study, the PTEN IHC results are also planned to be used for companion diagnostic test development.  Based on availability of tissue, additional diagnostic test development may be conducted and\/or further additional exploratory biomarkers may be evaluated, which may include but are not limited to, genomic analysis of tumour tissue to identify markers of response and resistance to study drugs.  For this purpose, an optional tumour sample (FFPE block [preferred] or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections) can be provided in screening Part 1.  For screening Part 2, eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) will be required to provide an additional tumour sample (FFPE block [preferred] or 20 [minimum 15] freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  Participants who provided optional additional tumour tissue in screening Part 1 are exempt from providing tumour in screening Part 2.  If fewer slides are available, the patient may still be eligible for the study, after discussion with and approval by the Medical Monitor.  Further details on tissue specifications are outlined in the Laboratory Manual.  China participants will not participate in these exploratory analyses. Mandatory Blood Samples for Exploratory Biomarker Analysis Blood samples will be collected for analysis of ctDNA (see Section 1.3).  The ctDNA samples collected at screening will be analysed for predictive biomarkers of response to treatment and may be used to develop and validate future in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests.  Several ctDNA samples will be taken during treatment and a final sample will be taken at disease progression.  These samples will be used for additional exploratory research which may include but is not limited to interrogation of changes in genetic alterations and potential mechanisms of resistance to treatment. For exploratory biomarker research, blood samples will be collected to provide plasma for circulating soluble factors and whole blood samples will be collected for DNA and RNA biomarkers.  These samples will be taken at multiple timepoints and analysed for a range of oncology and immunological biomarkers that may correlate with drug response.  These biomarkers may include, but are not limited to, panels of cytokines, chemokines and other soluble biomarkers; T-cell receptor repertoire analysis and analysis of gene expression biomarkers associated with immunomodulatory effects. Blood samples for the enumeration of CTCs using CellSearch assay will be collected at baseline, pre-treatment on Cycle 4\/Day 1, and at disease progression.  Blood samples will also be collected at Cycle 1\/Day 1 and on progression for the analysis of biomarkers detectable in CTCs using Epic Sciences assays. Details of sample collection, processing, shipping and storage are detailed in the Laboratory Manual. Blood samples for ctDNA testing, exploratory biomarker research, and CTC testing will not be collected from participants in China. 8.6.2  Collection of Optional Biomarker Samples Participants will sign an informed consent for the optional tumour tissue biopsies. Where possible, every effort should be made to collect optional samples for biomarker research from consenting patients in the study, as outlined in the SoA (see Section 1.3) and as follows: Paired biopsies: a baseline biopsy taken before the initial dosing of study drug at screening or pre-dose on Cycle 1, Day 1, and a biopsy taken on-treatment.  The on-treatment biopsy should be taken at least 4 hours post-dose between Cycle 1, Day 16 and Cycle 1, Day 18.  Biopsies should preferably be collected from the same tumour site.  The exact day, time and site of biopsy collection should be clearly noted in the associated documentation. An additional biopsy obtained at termination of treatment\/disease progression, if applicable. The tumour biopsy procedure will be performed by core needle, under radiological guidance, or surgically if the site of disease is superficial and palpable or visible.  It is mandated that the core biopsy be removed directly from the tumour in situ and not cored from a surgically removed tumour.  This is to ensure the best possible quality of the biopsy, so the blood\/nutrient supply to the tumour is not disrupted prior to biopsy collection.  Collection of tumour cells from fluid such as ascites or pleural effusion is not permitted.  The tumour samples may be analysed for biomarkers including, but not limited to, markers of PI3K\/AKT and AR pathways and treatment-induced changes in immunological markers such as CD8 expressing T-cells and PD-L1 expression. Collection of optional biomarker samples is not applicable for participants in China. 8.6.3  Other Study-related Biomarker Research Already collected samples may be analysed on different biomarkers thought to play a role in prostate cancer including, but not limited to, analysis of tumour tissue and peripheral blood samples for immunological biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression, TCR sequencing and gene expression analysis; chemokines and cytokines, and analysis of genes associated with AKT\/AR signalling in tumour tissue and ctDNA to evaluate their association with observed clinical responses to study drug.  For storage, re-use and destruction of biomarker samples see Section 8.5."

          "Text":"9  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 9.1  Statistical Hypotheses The null hypothesis for the primary time-to-event endpoint rPFS, defined as the time from randomisation until the date of objective disease progression (adopting RECIST 1.1 criteria for soft tissue lesions and PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions) or death (from any cause in the absence of progression), is that there is no difference in event rate between capivasertib + abiraterone and placebo + abiraterone.  The intention of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of capivasertib + abiraterone over placebo + abiraterone. 9.2  Sample Size Determination Assuming a true treatment effect HR of 0.70 (this translates to an approximate 18-month improvement in median rPFS over an assumed 43-month median rPFS on abiraterone, assuming rPFS is exponentially distributed), approximately 331 rPFS events must be observed for the study to have 90% power to show a statistically significant difference in rPFS at the 2-sided 5% level, allowing for an interim analysis for efficacy.  The smallest treatment difference that would be statistically significant with 331 events is an rPFS HR of 0.806. Assuming 33% maturity (with maturity defined as the proportion of patients having an event), 1000 participants must be randomised (in a 1:1 ratio).  To randomise approximately 1000 participants, it is expected that approximately 5500 participants will be screened. There will be an interim analysis of rPFS, once approximately 222 (22% maturity) rPFS events have been observed.  With 222 events, a significant result will be declared if the observed rPFS HR is 0.593 or better at this interim analysis with a 2-sided p-value < 0.0001 (approximate relative information fraction = 67%).  The interim analysis on rPFS will be incorporated into the MTP. If the null hypothesis (no rPFS benefit of capivasertib [+ abiraterone backbone] versus placebo [+ abiraterone backbone]) is not rejected, at the final analysis (DCO2), rPFS will be tested at \u03b1 = 0.05 (2-sided). The approximate timing of the interim analysis (DCO1), the occurrence of 222 events, is expected to be at 39 months from the date of First Subject In and the timing of the final analysis (DCO2), the occurrence of 331 events, is expected to be at 52 months from First Subject In.  This is based on exponentially distributed rPFS events times and non-uniform accrual of participants over the 30 months recruitment period.

This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the most important endpoints, including the primary and secondary endpoints. 9.4.1  General Considerations Analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representative.  A comprehensive SAP will be developed and finalised before the interim database cut and will describe the participant populations to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data.  This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints.  Any deviations from this plan will be reported in the CSR. 9.4.2  Efficacy Efficacy analyses will be performed based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) (ITT). 9.4.2.1  Primary Endpoint Radiographic PFS is defined in Section 8.1.2.1 as the time from randomisation until the date of objective disease progression (adopting RECIST 1.1 criteria for soft tissue lesions and PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions) or death (from any cause in the absence of progression) together with details of censoring. The effect of capivasertib versus placebo will be tested using a log rank test stratified by the randomisation stratification factors.  If there are insufficient events per strata, some strata will be collapsed following rules that will be pre-specified in the SAP.  The stratification variables in the statistical modelling will be based on the values entered into IWRS at randomisation. From the stratified Cox proportional hazards model (ties = Efron) the HR (capivasertib + abiraterone vs placebo + abiraterone) together with its corresponding 95% CI (calculated using a profile likelihood approach) will be presented.  A HR less than 1 will favour capivasertib + abiraterone. Subgroup analyses will be conducted comparing rPFS between the treatment arms.  The purpose of the subgroup analyses is to assess the consistency of treatment effect across potential or expected prognostic factors. The subgroups defined by the stratification factors (Section 4.1) will be analysed for rPFS. Additional subgroups of interest and analysis methods will be outlined in the SAP. No adjustment to the significance level for testing of subgroups will be made, since all of these subgroup analyses will be considered exploratory and may only be supportive of the primary analysis of PFS. A sensitivity analysis of rPFS as assessed by BICR assessment will also be conducted.  Further sensitivity analyses will be described in the SAP. 9.4.2.2  Key Secondary Endpoints Overall Survival Overall survival is defined in Section 8.1.3 together with details of censoring. Overall survival will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1), including subgroup analyses, and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. TFST TFST is defined in Section 8.1.5 together with details of censoring. TFST will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1) and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. SSE-FS SSE-FS is defined in Section 8.1.6 together with details of censoring. SSE-FS will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1) and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. Time to Pain Progression Time to pain progression (TTPP) is defined in Section 8.1.8.1.  TTPP will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1) and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. 9.4.2.3  Other Secondary Endpoints Time to PSA progression Time to PSA progression is defined in Section 8.1.4 together with details of censoring. Time to PSA progression will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1), and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% confidence interval will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. Time to Castration Resistance TTCR is defined in Section 8.1.7 together with details of censoring. TTCR will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1) and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. PFS2 PFS2 is defined in Section 8.1.2.5 together with details of censoring. PFS2 in the overall population will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1) and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Analysis details will be defined in the SAP. Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) Analysis details will be defined in the SAP. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate Cancer (FACT-P) Analysis details will be defined in the SAP. 9.4.2.4  Exploratory Endpoints Analyses of the following exploratory endpoints will be detailed in the SAP: Time to First Subsequent Chemotherapy, ORR, duration of response, PRO-CTCAE, and EQ-5D. 9.4.3  Safety Safety and tolerability will be assessed in terms of AEs and SAEs, physical examination findings, vital signs (including DBP\/SBP and pulse rate), ECG findings, and laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis parameters).  These will be collected for all participants. Adverse events will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) that will have been released for execution at AstraZeneca\/designee. Safety data will be presented using descriptive statistics unless otherwise specified. Adverse events will be presented for each treatment group by system organ class and preferred term, covering number and percentage of participants reporting at least one event and number of events where appropriate. AEs occurring prior to start of Investigational Product, treatment-emergent AEs, and post-treatment AEs will be presented separately. An overview of AEs will present for each treatment group the number and percentage of participants with any AE, AEs with outcome of death, serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of Investigational Product, as well as AEs leading to Investigational Product dose interruptions and AEs leading to Investigational Product dose reductions. Separate AE tables will be provided taken into consideration relationship as assessed by the investigator, CTCAE grade, seriousness, death and events leading to discontinuation of Investigational Product as well as other action taken related to Investigational Product, events of special interest and other significant adverse events. An additional table will present the number and percentage of participants with the most common AEs. In accordance with the requirements of the FDA, a separate table will present non-serious AEs occurring in more than 5% of participants in any treatment group. Key participant information will be presented for participants with AEs with outcome of death, serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of investigational product. An AE listing for the safety analysis set will cover details for each individual AE. Full details of AE analyses will be provided in the SAP. The following events are considered treatment emergent: AEs with onset date on or after first dose of IMP (ie, capivasertib, placebo, abiraterone) Worsening of pre-existing events on or after first dose of IMP Other safety data including physical examinations, clinical haematology, chemistry, urinalysis, vital signs and ECGs will be summarised using descriptive statistics. 9.4.4  Other Analyses The plasma concentration-time data of capivasertib in combination with abiraterone will be analysed by population PK methods using non-linear mixed-effects modelling.  PK parameters, including variability parameters, will be estimated as data permits.  The influence of intrinsic (eg, ethnicity, gender, age, weight, renal function, and hepatic function) and extrinsic (eg, concomitant medication) factors will be evaluated and exposure-response relationships will be explored.  Details will be outlined in a separate modelling analysis plan and results may be reported separately. PK analyses will be performed based on the PK Analysis Set and any exclusion of data will be documented and justified. Data from this study may be pooled with data from other studies. 9.4.5  Methods for Multiplicity Control In order to preserve the overall type 1 error, the key secondary endpoints of OS, TFST, SSE-FS, and time to pain progression will be tested following a MTP (Figure 3).  Each endpoint will have its own spending function.  Other than for rPFS, the alpha allocation for the secondary endpoints will be controlled at the interim and\/or the final analysis timepoints by using the Lan-DeMets spending function (Lan and DeMets 1983) that approximates the O'Brien-Fleming approach, where the significance level applied at the interim analysis depends upon the proportion of information (ie, information fraction) available.  Each endpoint will be tested according to the group-sequential Holm variable (GSHv) procedure (Ye et al 2013). The MTP will be detailed in the SAP.

At the interim analysis (first DCO [DCO1]), rPFS will be tested at \u03b1 = 0.0001 (2 sided) (assuming 67.0% information fraction); the critical value is HR = 0.593 with 222 rPFS events. Time to first subsequent therapy (TFST) will be analysed at DCO1 and DCO2 (final rPFS analysis).  Overall survival, SSE-FS, and TTPP will be analysed at DCO2 and DCO3, approximately 12 months after the final rPFS analysis at DCO2. The SAP will describe the planned interim analyses in greater detail. 9.6  Data Monitoring Committee An IDMC will be established to assess the safety of capivasertib in an unblinded manner.  The IDMC will be responsible for reviewing the safety data accruing in the study at regular intervals, and the interim efficacy analysis to provide a recommendation to AstraZeneca whether the study should continue unchanged, be stopped, or be modified in any way.  The IDMC will consist of at least 2 physicians with expertise in prostate cancer and one biostatistician.  Further information on the IDMC and schedule of meetings will be defined in the IDMC Charter."

          "Text":"9.2  Sample Size Determination Assuming a true treatment effect HR of 0.70 (this translates to an approximate 18-month improvement in median rPFS over an assumed 43-month median rPFS on abiraterone, assuming rPFS is exponentially distributed), approximately 331 rPFS events must be observed for the study to have 90% power to show a statistically significant difference in rPFS at the 2-sided 5% level, allowing for an interim analysis for efficacy.  The smallest treatment difference that would be statistically significant with 331 events is an rPFS HR of 0.806. Assuming 33% maturity (with maturity defined as the proportion of patients having an event), 1000 participants must be randomised (in a 1:1 ratio).  To randomise approximately 1000 participants, it is expected that approximately 5500 participants will be screened. There will be an interim analysis of rPFS, once approximately 222 (22% maturity) rPFS events have been observed.  With 222 events, a significant result will be declared if the observed rPFS HR is 0.593 or better at this interim analysis with a 2-sided p-value < 0.0001 (approximate relative information fraction = 67%).  The interim analysis on rPFS will be incorporated into the MTP. If the null hypothesis (no rPFS benefit of capivasertib [+ abiraterone backbone] versus placebo [+ abiraterone backbone]) is not rejected, at the final analysis (DCO2), rPFS will be tested at \u03b1 = 0.05 (2-sided). The approximate timing of the interim analysis (DCO1), the occurrence of 222 events, is expected to be at 39 months from the date of First Subject In and the timing of the final analysis (DCO2), the occurrence of 331 events, is expected to be at 52 months from First Subject In.  This is based on exponentially distributed rPFS events times and non-uniform accrual of participants over the 30 months recruitment period.

Appendix B  Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations B 1  Regulatory and Ethical Considerations This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and with the following: Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines Applicable ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines Applicable laws and regulations AstraZeneca will be responsible for obtaining the required authorisations to conduct the study from the concerned Regulatory Authority.  This responsibility may be delegated to a CRO, but the accountability remains with AstraZeneca. The protocol, protocol amendments, ICFs, Investigator Brochure, and other relevant documents (eg, advertisements) must be submitted to an IRB\/IEC by the investigator and reviewed and approved by the IRB\/IEC before the study is initiated. Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB\/IEC and applicable Regulatory Authority approval before implementation of changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study participants. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation.  The sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs\/IECs, and investigators. For all studies except those utilising medical devices investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB\/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. B 2  Financial Disclosure Investigators and sub-investigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information as requested to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities.  Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study. B 3  Informed Consent Process The investigator or his\/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the participant or their legally authorised representative and answer all questions regarding the study. Participants must be informed that their participation is voluntary, and they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason during the study.  Participants or their legally authorised representative will be required to sign a statement of informed consent that meets the requirements of 21 CFR 50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements, where applicable, and the IRB\/IEC or study centre, as well as any locally required privacy act document prior to performing any protocol-specific procedures including screening(s) and baseline evaluations.  A 2-stage process applies in this study and two ICFs are obtained according to the Schedule of Assessments (Section 1.3). The medical record must include a statement that written informed consent was obtained before any protocol-specific procedures were performed to the participant and the date the written consent was obtained.  The authorised person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF(s). Participants must be re-consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their participation in the study. A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the participant or the participant's legally authorised representative. If a participant declines to participate in any voluntary exploratory genetic research component of the study, there will be no penalty or loss of benefit to the participant and they will not be excluded from other aspects of the study. A participant who is rescreened is required to sign another ICF (relevant to the part the participant was consented to). The ICF will contain a separate section that addresses the use of remaining mandatory samples for optional exploratory research.  The investigator or authorised designee will explain to each participant the objectives of the exploratory research.  Participants will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason during the storage period.  The participant will give a separate agreement to allow any remaining specimens to be used for exploratory research.  Participants who decline to participate in this optional research will indicate this in the ICF. If a participant withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will be disposed of\/destroyed, and the action documented.  If samples already have been analysed at the time of the request, AstraZeneca will not be obliged to destroy the results of this research. B 4  Data Protection Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor.  Any participant records or datasets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names or any information which would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred. The participant must be informed that their personal study-related data will be used by the sponsor in accordance with local data protection law.  The level of disclosure and use of their data must also be explained to the participant in the informed consent The participant must be informed that their medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authorised personnel appointed by the sponsor, by appropriate IRB\/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities. B 5  Committees Structure The IDMC will be responsible for reviewing the unblinded safety data accruing in the study at regular intervals, and for reviewing the efficacy interim analysis.  The IDMC will consist of at least 2 physicians with expertise in prostate cancer and one biostatistician, and will be formed prior to the randomisation of the first participant.  Details will be described in the IDMC Charter. The composition of the study Steering Committee will be described in a Charter. B 6  Dissemination of Clinical Study Data A description of this clinical study will be available on http:\/\/astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com and http:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov as will the summary of the Study D361BC00001 results when they are available.  The clinical trial and\/or summary of Study D361BC00001 results may also be available on other websites according to the regulations of the countries in which Study D361BC00001 is conducted. B 7  Data Quality Assurance All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on eCRF unless transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data).  The investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or electronically signing the eCRF. The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the information entered in the eCRF. The investigator must permit study-related monitoring, audits, IRB\/IEC review, and regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. Monitoring details describing strategy (eg, risk-based initiatives in operations and quality such as Risk Management and Mitigation Strategies and Analytical Risk-Based Monitoring), methods, responsibilities and requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on-site monitoring) are provided in the Monitoring Plan. The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including quality checking of the data. The sponsor assumes accountability for actions delegated to other individuals (eg, Contract Research Organisations). Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the eCRF by authorised site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained by the investigator in accordance with local regulations unless institutional policies require a longer retention period.  No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the sponsor.  No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the sponsor. B 8  Source Documents Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the integrity of the data collected.  Source documents are filed at the investigator's site. Data reported on the eCRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained.  The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study.  Also, current medical records must be available. B 9  Study and Site Start and Closure The study start date is the date on which the clinical study will be open for recruitment of participants.  The first act of recruitment is the date of first participant enrolment and will be the study start date. The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor.  Study sites will be closed upon study completion.  A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed.  The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are not limited to: Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB\/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator Discontinuation of further study intervention development If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the investigators, the IECs\/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any contract research organisation(s) used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements.  The investigator shall promptly inform the participant and should assure appropriate participant therapy and\/or follow-up. Participants from terminated sites will have the opportunity to be transferred to another site to continue the study. B 10  Publication Policy The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings.  If this is foreseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor before submission.  This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments. The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results.  In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally support publication of multicentre studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data.  In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements. Appendix C  Guidance Regarding Potential Interactions of Capivasertib with Concomitant Medications C 1  Drugs that May Influence Capivasertib Pharmacokinetics Based on results from in vitro studies, capivasertib is a substrate of CYP3A4, although data suggests that glucuronidation may be the major metabolic route.  Co-administration of some CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase exposure to capivasertib and hence potentially affect toxicity, while CYP3A4 inducers may decrease the exposure to capivasertib and may potentially affect efficacy. The following lists (Table 15) are not intended to be exhaustive and a similar restriction will apply to other agents that are known to modulate CYP3A4 activity.  Appropriate medical judgment is required.  Please contact AstraZeneca with any queries you have on this issue.

Please refer to full prescribing information for all drugs prior to co-administration with capivasertib. C 3  Guidance for Statins Atorvastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin should be avoided due to the potential for increased exposure through inhibition of CYP3A4 by capivasertib (Table 16). Fluvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin are minimally influenced by CYP3A4 inhibitors, conveying a relatively low potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions via this mechanism. Capivasertib also has a potential to inhibit the organic-anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP-1B1) transporter, which is implicated in the distribution and clearance of many of the statins.  The predicted increase in the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) is 1.3-fold for pravastatin and 1.5-fold for rosuvastatin.  It is, therefore, recommended that doses of pravastatin be capped to 40 mg once daily and rosuvastatin be capped to 10 mg once daily when combined with capivasertib, including 1 week prior to capivasertib administration and for 1 week following discontinuation of capivasertib. In summary, rosuvastatin (up to 10 mg once daily), pravastatin (up to 40 mg once daily) and fluvastatin are appropriate agents to be used in participants included in capivasertib studies who require statin therapy.

Female partners of male participants should also use a highly effective form of contraception if they are of childbearing potential. Highly effective methods of contraception include: Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, intravaginal, or transdermal, Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, injectable, or implantable, Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), Bilateral tubal occlusion, Male partner sterilisation (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate), True abstinence (ie, not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of study treatment and the treatment washout period is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control). Acceptable method of contraception: Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical\/vault caps) with spermicidal foam\/gel\/film\/cream\/suppository. It is not known whether capivasertib has the capacity to affect the metabolism of hormonal contraceptives, so hormonal contraception should also be combined with a barrier method of contraception. Appendix E  Guidelines for Evaluation of Objective Tumour Response Using RECIST 1.1 Criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) in Soft Tissue and PCWG3 (Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3) in Bone Lesions E 1  INTRODUCTION This appendix details the implementation of RECIST 1.1 Guidelines (Eisenhauer et al 2009) and PCWG 3 guidelines (Scher et al 2016) for Study D361BC00001 with regards to assessment of tumour burden including protocol-specific requirements for this study. E 2  ASSESSMENT OF SOFT TISSUE DISEASE USING RECIST 1.1 CRITERIA Definition of Measurable, Non-measurable, Target, and Non-target Lesions In this study, bone lesions, with the exception of lytic lesions with a soft tissue component, will not be included in the RECIST assessment, neither as target lesions (TL), non-target lesions (NTL), or new lesions.  Bone lesions will be followed-up using a modified version of the PCWG3 criteria and the guidelines for bone lesion assessments are defined in the bone lesion section of this appendix (Section E 3). Measurable: A lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline as \u2265 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis \u2265 15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements. Non-measurable: All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with \u2265 10 to < 15 mm short axis at baseline*). Truly non-measurable lesions include the following: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural\/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses\/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable by CT or MRI. Previously irradiated lesions** * Nodes with < 10 mm short axis are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed as NTL. ** Localised post-radiation changes which affect lesion sizes may occur.  Therefore, lesions that have been previously irradiated will not be considered measurable and must be selected as NTL at baseline and followed up as part of the NTL assessment. Special Cases: Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability.  Blastic lesions are considered non-measurable. Cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for measurability from a radiological point of view, but if non-cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these should be selected as target lesions. Target Lesions: A maximum of 5 measurable lesions (with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ), representative of all lesions involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as TL at baseline. Non-Target Lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should be identified as NTL at baseline (except bone lesions, which will be assessed as defined in bone lesion section of this appendix [Section E 3]). Methods of Assessment The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterise each identified and recorded lesion at baseline and during follow-up visits. A summary of the methods to be used for RECIST assessment is provided below and those excluded from tumour assessments for this study are highlighted, with the rationale provided. Table 18  Summary of Methods of Assessment Target Lesions  Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions  Non-Target Lesions New Lesions  New Lesions CT (preferred)  CT (preferred) MRI  MRI CT (preferred)  CT (preferred) MRI  MRI X-ray, Chest X-ray  X-ray, Chest X-ray CT (preferred)  CT (preferred) MRI  MRI X-ray, Chest X-ray  X-ray, Chest X-ray FDG-PET  FDG-PET Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions New Lesions CT (preferred) MRI CT (preferred) MRI X-ray, Chest X-ray CT (preferred) MRI X-ray, Chest X-ray FDG-PET CT and MRI CT and MRI are generally considered to be the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure TL selected for response assessment and to assess NTL and identification of any new lesions. In Study D361BC00001, it is recommended that CT examinations of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be used to assess tumour burden at baseline and follow-up visits.  CT examination with intravenous (iv) contrast media administration is the preferred method.  MRI should be used where CT is not feasible or is medically contraindicated.  For brain lesion assessment, MRI is the preferred method. Every effort should be made to maintain the radiologic imaging modality used at baseline throughout subsequent assessments. Chest X-ray In Study D361BC00001, chest X-ray assessment will not be used for assessment of TL as they will be assessed by CT examination or MRI examination.  Chest X-ray can, however, be used to assess NTL and to identify the presence of new lesions. Ultrasound In Study D361BC00001, ultrasound examination will not be used for assessment of TL and NTL as it is not a reproducible method, does not provide an accurate assessment of tumour size and it is subjective and operator dependent.  Ultrasound examination can, however, be used to identify the presence of new lesions.  If new clinical symptoms occur and an ultrasound is performed, then new lesions should be confirmed by CT or MRI examination. Endoscopy and Laparoscopy In Study D361BC00001, endoscopy and laparoscopy will not be used for tumour assessments as they are not validated in the context of tumour assessment. Tumour Markers In Study D361BC00001, tumour markers will not be used for tumour response assessments as per RECIST 1.1. In this study, PSA levels are being collected for separate analysis; however, the results will not contribute to tumour response based on RECIST 1.1 assessment. Cytology and Histology In Study D361BC00001, histology and cytology will not be used for tumour response assessments as per RECIST 1.1 and tumour response assessments will be performed on radiological criteria only. FDG-PET Scan In Study D361BC00001 FDG-PET scans may be used as a method for identifying new lesions, according with the following algorithm: New lesions will be recorded where there is positive FDG uptake* not present on baseline FDG-PET scan or in a location corresponding to a new lesion on CT\/MRI at the same follow-up visit.  If there is no baseline FDG-PET scan available, and no evidence of new lesions on CT\/MRI scans then follow-up CT\/MRI assessments should be continued, scheduled as per protocol or clinically indicated, in order to confirm new lesions. * A positive FDG-PET scan lesion should be reported only when an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue is observed. Tumour Response Evaluation Schedule of Evaluation Baseline assessments should encompass all areas of known predilection for metastases in the disease under evaluation and should additionally investigate areas that may be involved based on signs and symptoms of individual participants and should be performed no more than 28 days before the start of study treatment.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) after randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) or modified PCWG3 (bone).  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be adequately imaged at follow-up. If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their originally scheduled visits.  This schedule is to be followed in order to minimise any unintentional bias caused by some participants being assessed at a different frequency than other participants. Target Lesions (TL) Documentation of Target Lesions A maximum of 5 measurable lesions, with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ (including lymph nodes), representative of all lesions involved should be identified as TL at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (longest diameter for non-nodal lesions or short axis for nodal lesions), but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected. The site and location of each TL should be documented as well as the longest diameter for non-nodal lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes).  All measurements should be recorded in millimetres.  At baseline the sum of the diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters.  At follow-up visits the sum of diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as the follow-up sum of diameters. Special Cases: For TL measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the longest diameter.  For pathological lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the short axis. If the CT\/MRI slice thickness used is > 5 mm, the minimum size of measurable disease at baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan. If a lesion has completely disappeared, the longest diameter should be recorded as 0 mm. If a TL splits into 2 or more parts, then record the sum of the diameters of those parts. If 2 or more TL merge, then the sum of the diameters of the combined lesion should be recorded for 1 of the lesions and 0 mm recorded for the other lesion(s). If a TL is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned.  If an accurate measure can be given, this should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm. If a TL cannot be measured accurately due to it being too large, provide an estimate of the size of the lesion. When a TL has had any intervention eg, radiotherapy, embolisation, surgery etc., during the study, the size of the TL should still be provided where possible. Evaluation of Target Lesions This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumour visit response for TL.

Not Evaluable (NE) Only relevant if any of the target lesions were not assessed or not evaluable or had a lesion intervention at this visit.  Note: If the sum of diameters meets the PD criteria, PD overrides not evaluable as a TL response. Not Applicable If the participant had no target lesion at baseline. Non-Target Lesions (NTL) Evaluation of Non-target Lesions All other lesions (or sites of disease), except for bone lesions, not recorded as TL should be identified as NTL at baseline.  Measurements are not required for these lesions, but their status should be followed at subsequent visits.  At each visit an overall assessment of the NTL response should be recorded by the investigator.  This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine and record overall response for NTL at the investigational site at each visit. Table 20  Evaluation of Non-target Lesions Complete Response (CR)  Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all non-target lesions (NTL) since baseline.

Unequivocal progression may be due to an important progression in 1 lesion only or in several lesions.

Not Evaluable (NE) Only relevant when 1 or some of the NTL were not assessed and, in the investigator's opinion, they are not able to provide an evaluable overall NTL assessment at this visit. Note: For participants without TL at baseline, this is relevant if any of the NTL were not assessed at this visit and the progression criteria have not been met. Not Applicable If the participant had no NTL at baseline. To achieve \u2018unequivocal progression' on the basis of NTL, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest \u2018increase' in the size of 1 or more NTL is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. New Lesions Details of any new soft tissue lesions will also be recorded with the date of assessment.  The presence of 1 or more new lesions is assessed as progression. A lesion identified at a follow up assessment in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumour. If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumour assessments should be continued until the new lesion has been confirmed.  If repeat scans confirm there is a new lesion, then the progression date should be declared using the date of the initial scan. Evaluation of Overall Visit Soft Tissue Response The overall visit response will be derived using the algorithm shown in Table 21.

E 3  ASSESSMENT OF BONE LESION PROGRESSION USING PCWG3 CRITERIA A modified version of PCWG3 will be used in this study.  The deviation from the PCWG3 guideline is that for all visits after the first scan post-baseline; no confirmatory scan is requested to assess PD.  Bone lesions will be assessed by bone scan and will not be part of the RECIST v1.1 malignant soft tissue assessment. Method of Assessment Bone lesions identified on a whole-body isotopic bone scan at baseline should be recorded and followed by the same method as per baseline assessment. In Study D361BC00001, isotopic bone scans will be used as a method of assessment to identify the presence of new bone lesions at follow-up visits.  New lesions will be recorded where a positive and unequivocal hot-spot that was not present on the baseline bone scan assessment is identified on a bone scan performed at any time during the study.  The investigator should consider the positive hot-spot to be a significant new site of malignant disease and represent true disease progression in order to record the new lesion. Tumour Progression Evaluation Schedule of the Evaluation Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before the start of study treatment.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) after randomisation until objective disease progression assessed by investigator as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) or PCWG3 (bone). If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their originally scheduled visits.  This schedule is to be followed in order to minimise any unintentional bias caused by some participants being assessed at a different frequency than other participants. Documentation of Lesions All bone lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified at baseline.  Their status should be followed at subsequent visits.  At each visit an overall assessment of the bone lesion progression should be recorded by the investigator.  This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine and record bone progression at the investigational site at each visit. Progression on a bone scan is identified using modified PCWG3 criteria, by having 2 or more new metastatic bone lesions: For patients without progression at the first visit after baseline, the scan from this first visit after baseline now serves as new reference for all subsequent scans, ie, assuming all visits are acquired according to schedule all bone scans after Week 16 are compared to the Week 16 scan. The requirements for determination and confirmation of radiographic progression by either bone scan (bone progression) or CT\/MRI (soft tissue progression) are summarised in Table 22.

It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. During the course of the study the investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry.  The investigator is responsible for determining whether a participant meets potential PHL criteria at any point during the study. All sources of laboratory data are appropriate for the determination of PHL and HL events; this includes samples taken at scheduled study visits and other visits including central and all local laboratory evaluations even if collected outside of the study visits; for example, PHL criteria could be met by an elevated ALT from a central laboratory and\/or elevated TBL from a local laboratory. The investigator will also review Adverse Event data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevations in liver biochemistry) for possible PHL events. The investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy's Law (HL) criteria are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP). The investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL\/HL cases and for reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events (AEs) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes. G 2  Definitions Potential Hy's Law (PHL) Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) \u2265 3x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) together with Total Bilirubin (TBL) \u2265 2xULN at any point during the study following the start of study medication irrespective of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP). Hy's Law (HL) AST or ALT \u2265 3x ULN together with TBL \u2265 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, can be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug. For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur. G 3  Identification of Potential Hy's Law Cases In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any participant who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in combination: ALT \u2265 3xULN AST \u2265 3xULN TBL \u2265 2xULN The investigator will without delay review each new laboratory report and if the identification criteria are met will: Notify the AstraZeneca representative Determine whether the participant meets PHL criteria (see Section G 2 for definition) by reviewing laboratory reports from all previous visits Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory eCRF G 4  Follow-up G 4.1  Potential Hy's Law Criteria Not Met If the participant does not meet PHL criteria the investigator will: Inform the AstraZeneca representative that the participant has not met PHL criteria. Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance provided in the Clinical Study Protocol. G 4.2  Potential Hy's Law Criteria Met If the participant does meet PHL criteria the investigator will: Notify the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central Study Team. Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the investigator will report the case as an SAE of Potential Hy's Law; serious criteria \u2018Important medical event' and causality assessment \u2018yes\/related' according to CSP process for SAE reporting. For participants that met PHL criteria prior to starting IMP, the investigator is not required to submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change in the participant's condition. The Study Physician contacts the investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an approach for the study participants' follow-up (including any further laboratory testing) and the continuous review of data. Subsequent to this contact the investigator will: Monitor the participant until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated.  Completes follow-up SAE Form as required. Investigate the aetiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as discussed with the Study Physician. Complete the three Liver eCRF Modules as information becomes available. #A \u2018significant' change in the participant's condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, or total bilirubin) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the investigator, this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty. G 5  Review and Assessment of Potential Hy's Law Cases The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met. As soon as possible after the biochemistry abnormality was initially detected, the Study Physician contacts the investigator in order to review available data and agree on whether there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the IMP, to ensure timely analysis and reporting to health authorities within 15 calendar days from date PHL criteria was met.  The AstraZeneca Global Clinical Lead or equivalent and Global Safety Physician will also be involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as appropriate. According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the investigator will follow the instructions below. Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE: If the alternative explanation is not an AE, record the alternative explanation on the appropriate eCRF. If the alternative explanation is an AE\/SAE: update the previously submitted Potential Hy's Law SAE and AE eCRFs accordingly with the new information (reassessing event term; causality and seriousness criteria) following the AstraZeneca standard processes. If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL elevations other than the IMP: Send updated SAE (report term \u2018Hy's Law') according to AstraZeneca standard processes. The \u2018Medically Important' serious criterion should be used if no other serious criteria apply. As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of \u2018related' should be assigned. If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 15 calendar days in obtaining the information necessary to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made: Provides any further update to the previously submitted SAE of Potential Hy's Law, (report term now \u2018Hy's Law case') ensuring causality assessment is related to IMP and seriousness criteria is medically important, according to CSP process for SAE reporting. Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine whether HL criteria are still met.  Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report following CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review and amending the reported term if an alternative explanation for the liver biochemistry elevations is determined.

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a deterioration of a pre-existing medical occurrence.  An AE may occur at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no Study treatment has been administered. H 2  Definitions of Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run-in, treatment, washout, follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: Results in death Is immediately life-threatening Requires in-participant hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the participant or may require medical treatment to prevent one of the outcomes listed above The above instruction applies only when the malignant tumour event in question is a new malignant tumour (ie, it is not the tumour for which entry into the study is a criterion and that is being treated by the IP under study and is not the development of new or progression of existing metastasis to the tumour under study).  Malignant tumours that - as part of normal, if rare, progression - undergo transformation (eg, Richter's transformation of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia into diffuse large B cell lymphoma) should not be considered a new malignant tumour. Life-threatening \u2018Life-threatening' means that the participant was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred, or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the participant's death.  \u2018Life-threatening' does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure). Hospitalisation Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospital admissions and\/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the participant was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study. Important Medical Event or Medical Treatment Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situations where important medical events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death, hospitalisation, disability or incapacity but may jeopardise the participant or may require medical treatment to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.  These should usually be considered as serious. Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical judgement must be used. Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone treatment Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N-acetylcysteine Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation Development of drug dependency or drug abuse Intensity Rating Scale The grading scales found in the revised National Cancer Institute CTCAE latest version will be utilised for all events with an assigned CTCAE grading.  For those events without assigned CTCAE grades, the recommendation in the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, moderate and severe events into CTCAE grades should be used.  A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program website (http:\/\/ctep.cancer.gov).  The applicable version of CTCAE should be described clearly. It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Appendix H 2.  An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Appendix H 2.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix H 2. H 3  A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question When making an assessment of causality consider the following factors when deciding if there is a \u2018reasonable possibility' that an AE may have been caused by the drug. Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the participant actually received the suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug? Consistency with known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological properties? De-challenge experience.  Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect drug? No alternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors. Re-challenge experience.  Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge. Laboratory tests.  A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship. In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: Is this a recognised feature of overdose of the drug? Is there a known mechanism? Causality of \u2018related' is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a \u2018reasonable possibility' of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expression \u2018reasonable possibility' of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough information to make an informed judgment.  With no available facts or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, the event(s) will be assessed as \u2018not related'. Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility. H 4  Medication Error For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study drug that either causes harm to the participant or has the potential to cause harm to the participant. A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or participant. Medication error includes situations where an error. occurred was identified and intercepted before the participant received the drug did not occur, but circumstances were recognised that could have led to an error Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors: Drug name confusion Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to the participant Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of administration Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet dissolved in water when it should be taken as a solid tablet Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature Wrong participant received the medication (excluding IWRS errors) Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IWRS errors) Examples of events that do not require reporting as medication errors in clinical studies: Errors related to or resulting from IWRS - including those which lead to one of the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error Participant accidentally missed drug dose(s) eg, forgot to take medication Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose) Participant failed to return unused medication or empty packaging None Capivasertib (AZD5363) Errors related to background and rescue medication, or standard of care medication in open label studies, even if an AstraZeneca product Medication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the medication error.  Appendix I  Handling of Human Biological Samples I 1  Chain of Custody A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle. The investigator at each centre keeps full traceability of collected biological samples from the participants while in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate) and records relevant processing information related to the samples whilst at site. The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps record of receipt of arrival and onward shipment or disposal. AstraZeneca or delegated representatives will keep oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring of study sites, auditing or process checks, and contractual requirements of external laboratory providers. Samples retained for further use will be stored in the AstraZeneca-assigned biobanks or other sample archive facilities and will be tracked by the appropriate AstraZeneca Team during for the remainder of the sample life cycle. If required, AstraZeneca will ensure that remaining biological samples are returned to the site according to local regulations or at the end of the retention period, whichever is the sooner. Procedures for biobanking samples as described above will be not applicable to China, and all residual sample from testing in China will be managed as per all applicable local regulations. I 2  Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Donated Biological Samples If a participant withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will be disposed of\/destroyed\/repatriated, and the action documented.  If samples are already analysed, AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy the results of this research. Following withdrawal of consent for biological samples, further study participation should be considered in relation to the withdrawal processes outlined in the informed consent. The investigator: Ensures participant's withdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is highlighted immediately to AstraZeneca or delegate. Ensures that relevant human biological samples from that participant, if stored at the study site, are immediately identified, disposed of as appropriate, and the action documented. Ensures that the participant and AstraZeneca are informed about the sample disposal. AstraZeneca ensures the organisation(s) holding the samples is\/are informed about the withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of or repatriated as appropriate, and the action documented and study site notified. I 3  International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) 6.2 Guidance Document LABELLING AND SHIPMENT OF BIOHAZARD SAMPLES International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) (https:\/\/www.iata.org\/whatwedo\/cargo\/dgr\/Pages\/download.aspx) classifies infectious substances into 3 categories: Category A, Category B or Exempt Category A Infectious Substances are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals. Category A pathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus.  Infectious substances meeting these criteria which cause disease in humans or both in humans and animals must be assigned to UN 2814.  Infectious substances which cause disease only in animals must be assigned to UN 2900: Category B Infectious Substances are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in Category A.  Category B pathogens are eg, Hepatitis A, C, D, and E viruses.  They are assigned the following UN number and proper shipping name UN 3373 - Biological Substance, Category B are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650 Exempt - Substances which do not contain infectious substances or substances which are unlikely to cause disease in humans or animals are not subject to these Regulations unless they meet the criteria for inclusion in another class. Clinical study samples will fall into Category B or exempt under IATA regulations Clinical study samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient temperature in IATA 650 compliant packaging (https:\/\/www.iata.org\/whatwedo\/cargo\/dgr\/Documents\/DGR-60-EN-PI650.pdf). Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods specification for the dry-ice content Appendix J  Optional Genomics Initiative Sample J 1  Use\/analysis of DNA AstraZeneca intends to collect and store DNA for genetic research to explore how genetic variations may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis of diseases, and the response to medications.  This genetic research may lead to better understanding of diseases, better diagnosis of diseases or other improvements in health care and to the discovery of new diagnostics, treatments or medications.  Therefore, where local regulations and IRB\/IEC allow, a blood sample will be collected for DNA analysis from consenting participants. This optional genetic research may consist of the analysis of the structure of the participant's DNA, ie, the entire genome. The results of genetic analyses may be reported in a separate study summary. The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality. The samples will be retained while research on capivasertib continues but no longer than 15 years or other period as per local requirements. J 2  Genetic Research Plan and Procedures Selection of Genetic Research Population All participants will be asked to participate in this genetic research, except for China participants.  Samples for genomics initiative research will not be collected for participants in China.  Participation is voluntary and if a participant declines to participate there will be no penalty or loss of benefit.  The participant will not be excluded from any aspect of the main study. Inclusion Criteria For inclusion in this genetic research, participants must fulfil all of the inclusion criteria described in the main body of the Clinical Study Protocol and: Provide informed consent for the Genomics Initiative sampling and analyses. Exclusion Criteria Exclusion from this genetic research may be for any of the exclusion criteria specified in the main study or any of the following: Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion in 120 days of genetic sample collection Withdrawal of Consent for Genetic Research Participants may withdraw from this genetic research at any time, independent of any decision concerning participation in other aspects of the main study.  Voluntary withdrawal will not prejudice further treatment.  Procedures for withdrawal are outlined in Section 7.2 of the main Clinical Study Protocol. Collection of Samples for Genetic Research A 6 mL blood sample for this genetic research will be obtained from the participants pre-dose on Cycle 1, Day 1, after randomisation.  Although DNA is stable, early sample collection is preferred to avoid introducing bias through excluding participants who may withdraw due to an adverse event (AE).  If for any reason the sample is not drawn at Cycle 1, Day 1, it may be taken at any visit until the last study visit.  Only one sample should be collected per participant for genetics during the study. Coding and Storage of DNA Samples The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genetic analysis are important to maintain participant confidentiality.  Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years, from the date of last participant last visit, after which they will be destroyed.  DNA is a finite resource that is used up during analyses.  Samples will be stored and used until no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached. An additional second code will be assigned to the sample either before or at the time of DNA extraction replacing the information on the sample tube.  Thereafter, the sample will be identifiable only by the second, unique number.  This number is used to identify the sample and corresponding data at the AstraZeneca genetics laboratories, or at the designated organisation.  No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any person (AstraZeneca employee or designated organisations working with the DNA). The link between the participant enrolment\/randomisation code and the second number will be maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at AstraZeneca or designated organisations.  The link will be used to identify the relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitate correlation of genotypic results with clinical data, allow regulatory audit, and permit tracing of samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of consent. Ethical and Regulatory Requirements The principles for ethical and regulatory requirements for the study, including this genetics research component, are outlined in Appendix B. Informed Consent The genetic component of this study is optional and the participant may participate in other components of the main study without participating in this genetic component.  To participate in the genetic component of the study the participant must sign and date both the consent form for the main study and the addendum for the Genomics Initiative component of the study.  Copies of both signed and dated consent forms must be given to the participant and the original filed at the study centre.  The Principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is given freely and that the participant understands that they may freely withdrawal from the genetic aspect of the study at any time. Participant Data Protection AstraZeneca will not provide individual genotype results to participants, any insurance company, any employer, their family members, general physician unless required to do so by law. Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked to the identity of the participant.  In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a participant.  For example, in the case of a medical emergency, an AstraZeneca Physician or an investigator might know a participant's identity and also have access to his or her genetic data.  Regulatory authorities may require access to the relevant files, though the participant's medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate. Data Management Any genetic data generated in this study will be stored at a secure system at AstraZeneca and\/or designated organisations to analyse the samples. AstraZeneca and its designated organisations may share summary results (such as genetic differences from groups of individuals with a disease) from this genetic research with other researchers, such as hospitals, academic organisations, or health insurance companies.  This can be done by placing the results in scientific databases, where they can be combined with the results of similar studies to learn even more about health and disease.  The researchers can only use this information for health-related research purposes.  Researchers may see summary results, but they will not be able to see individual participant data or any personal identifiers. Some or all of the clinical datasets from the main study may be merged with the genetic data in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database.

Appendix B  Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations B 1  Regulatory and Ethical Considerations This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and with the following: Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines Applicable ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines Applicable laws and regulations AstraZeneca will be responsible for obtaining the required authorisations to conduct the study from the concerned Regulatory Authority.  This responsibility may be delegated to a CRO, but the accountability remains with AstraZeneca. The protocol, protocol amendments, ICFs, Investigator Brochure, and other relevant documents (eg, advertisements) must be submitted to an IRB\/IEC by the investigator and reviewed and approved by the IRB\/IEC before the study is initiated. Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB\/IEC and applicable Regulatory Authority approval before implementation of changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study participants. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation.  The sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs\/IECs, and investigators. For all studies except those utilising medical devices investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB\/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements."

          "Section":"B\u00a03 Informed Consent Process",
          "Text":"B 3  Informed Consent Process The investigator or his\/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the participant or their legally authorised representative and answer all questions regarding the study. Participants must be informed that their participation is voluntary, and they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason during the study.  Participants or their legally authorised representative will be required to sign a statement of informed consent that meets the requirements of 21 CFR 50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements, where applicable, and the IRB\/IEC or study centre, as well as any locally required privacy act document prior to performing any protocol-specific procedures including screening(s) and baseline evaluations.  A 2-stage process applies in this study and two ICFs are obtained according to the Schedule of Assessments (Section 1.3). The medical record must include a statement that written informed consent was obtained before any protocol-specific procedures were performed to the participant and the date the written consent was obtained.  The authorised person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF(s). Participants must be re-consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their participation in the study. A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the participant or the participant's legally authorised representative. If a participant declines to participate in any voluntary exploratory genetic research component of the study, there will be no penalty or loss of benefit to the participant and they will not be excluded from other aspects of the study. A participant who is rescreened is required to sign another ICF (relevant to the part the participant was consented to). The ICF will contain a separate section that addresses the use of remaining mandatory samples for optional exploratory research.  The investigator or authorised designee will explain to each participant the objectives of the exploratory research.  Participants will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason during the storage period.  The participant will give a separate agreement to allow any remaining specimens to be used for exploratory research.  Participants who decline to participate in this optional research will indicate this in the ICF. If a participant withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will be disposed of\/destroyed, and the action documented.

Appendix C  Guidance Regarding Potential Interactions of Capivasertib with Concomitant Medications C 1  Drugs that May Influence Capivasertib Pharmacokinetics Based on results from in vitro studies, capivasertib is a substrate of CYP3A4, although data suggests that glucuronidation may be the major metabolic route.

          "Text":"C 3  Guidance for Statins Atorvastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin should be avoided due to the potential for increased exposure through inhibition of CYP3A4 by capivasertib (Table 16). Fluvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin are minimally influenced by CYP3A4 inhibitors, conveying a relatively low potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions via this mechanism. Capivasertib also has a potential to inhibit the organic-anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP-1B1) transporter, which is implicated in the distribution and clearance of many of the statins.  The predicted increase in the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) is 1.3-fold for pravastatin and 1.5-fold for rosuvastatin.  It is, therefore, recommended that doses of pravastatin be capped to 40 mg once daily and rosuvastatin be capped to 10 mg once daily when combined with capivasertib, including 1 week prior to capivasertib administration and for 1 week following discontinuation of capivasertib. In summary, rosuvastatin (up to 10 mg once daily), pravastatin (up to 40 mg once daily) and fluvastatin are appropriate agents to be used in participants included in capivasertib studies who require statin therapy."

Bone lesions will be followed-up using a modified version of the PCWG3 criteria and the guidelines for bone lesion assessments are defined in the bone lesion section of this appendix (Section E 3). Measurable: A lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline as \u2265 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis \u2265 15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements. Non-measurable: All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with \u2265 10 to < 15 mm short axis at baseline*). Truly non-measurable lesions include the following: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural\/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses\/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable by CT or MRI. Previously irradiated lesions** * Nodes with < 10 mm short axis are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed as NTL. ** Localised post-radiation changes which affect lesion sizes may occur.  Therefore, lesions that have been previously irradiated will not be considered measurable and must be selected as NTL at baseline and followed up as part of the NTL assessment. Special Cases: Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability.  Blastic lesions are considered non-measurable. Cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for measurability from a radiological point of view, but if non-cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these should be selected as target lesions. Target Lesions: A maximum of 5 measurable lesions (with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ), representative of all lesions involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as TL at baseline. Non-Target Lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should be identified as NTL at baseline (except bone lesions, which will be assessed as defined in bone lesion section of this appendix [Section E 3]). Methods of Assessment The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterise each identified and recorded lesion at baseline and during follow-up visits. A summary of the methods to be used for RECIST assessment is provided below and those excluded from tumour assessments for this study are highlighted, with the rationale provided. Table 18  Summary of Methods of Assessment Target Lesions  Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions  Non-Target Lesions New Lesions  New Lesions CT (preferred)  CT (preferred) MRI  MRI CT (preferred)  CT (preferred) MRI  MRI X-ray, Chest X-ray  X-ray, Chest X-ray CT (preferred)  CT (preferred) MRI  MRI X-ray, Chest X-ray  X-ray, Chest X-ray FDG-PET  FDG-PET Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions New Lesions CT (preferred) MRI CT (preferred) MRI X-ray, Chest X-ray CT (preferred) MRI X-ray, Chest X-ray FDG-PET CT and MRI CT and MRI are generally considered to be the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure TL selected for response assessment and to assess NTL and identification of any new lesions. In Study D361BC00001, it is recommended that CT examinations of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be used to assess tumour burden at baseline and follow-up visits.  CT examination with intravenous (iv) contrast media administration is the preferred method.  MRI should be used where CT is not feasible or is medically contraindicated.  For brain lesion assessment, MRI is the preferred method. Every effort should be made to maintain the radiologic imaging modality used at baseline throughout subsequent assessments. Chest X-ray In Study D361BC00001, chest X-ray assessment will not be used for assessment of TL as they will be assessed by CT examination or MRI examination.  Chest X-ray can, however, be used to assess NTL and to identify the presence of new lesions. Ultrasound In Study D361BC00001, ultrasound examination will not be used for assessment of TL and NTL as it is not a reproducible method, does not provide an accurate assessment of tumour size and it is subjective and operator dependent.  Ultrasound examination can, however, be used to identify the presence of new lesions.  If new clinical symptoms occur and an ultrasound is performed, then new lesions should be confirmed by CT or MRI examination. Endoscopy and Laparoscopy In Study D361BC00001, endoscopy and laparoscopy will not be used for tumour assessments as they are not validated in the context of tumour assessment. Tumour Markers In Study D361BC00001, tumour markers will not be used for tumour response assessments as per RECIST 1.1. In this study, PSA levels are being collected for separate analysis; however, the results will not contribute to tumour response based on RECIST 1.1 assessment. Cytology and Histology In Study D361BC00001, histology and cytology will not be used for tumour response assessments as per RECIST 1.1 and tumour response assessments will be performed on radiological criteria only. FDG-PET Scan In Study D361BC00001 FDG-PET scans may be used as a method for identifying new lesions, according with the following algorithm: New lesions will be recorded where there is positive FDG uptake* not present on baseline FDG-PET scan or in a location corresponding to a new lesion on CT\/MRI at the same follow-up visit.  If there is no baseline FDG-PET scan available, and no evidence of new lesions on CT\/MRI scans then follow-up CT\/MRI assessments should be continued, scheduled as per protocol or clinically indicated, in order to confirm new lesions. * A positive FDG-PET scan lesion should be reported only when an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue is observed. Tumour Response Evaluation Schedule of Evaluation Baseline assessments should encompass all areas of known predilection for metastases in the disease under evaluation and should additionally investigate areas that may be involved based on signs and symptoms of individual participants and should be performed no more than 28 days before the start of study treatment.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) after randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) or modified PCWG3 (bone).  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be adequately imaged at follow-up. If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their originally scheduled visits.  This schedule is to be followed in order to minimise any unintentional bias caused by some participants being assessed at a different frequency than other participants. Target Lesions (TL) Documentation of Target Lesions A maximum of 5 measurable lesions, with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ (including lymph nodes), representative of all lesions involved should be identified as TL at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (longest diameter for non-nodal lesions or short axis for nodal lesions), but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected. The site and location of each TL should be documented as well as the longest diameter for non-nodal lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes).  All measurements should be recorded in millimetres.  At baseline the sum of the diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters.  At follow-up visits the sum of diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as the follow-up sum of diameters. Special Cases: For TL measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the longest diameter.  For pathological lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the short axis. If the CT\/MRI slice thickness used is > 5 mm, the minimum size of measurable disease at baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan. If a lesion has completely disappeared, the longest diameter should be recorded as 0 mm. If a TL splits into 2 or more parts, then record the sum of the diameters of those parts. If 2 or more TL merge, then the sum of the diameters of the combined lesion should be recorded for 1 of the lesions and 0 mm recorded for the other lesion(s). If a TL is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned.  If an accurate measure can be given, this should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm. If a TL cannot be measured accurately due to it being too large, provide an estimate of the size of the lesion. When a TL has had any intervention eg, radiotherapy, embolisation, surgery etc., during the study, the size of the TL should still be provided where possible.

Non-Target Lesions (NTL) Evaluation of Non-target Lesions All other lesions (or sites of disease), except for bone lesions, not recorded as TL should be identified as NTL at baseline.  Measurements are not required for these lesions, but their status should be followed at subsequent visits.  At each visit an overall assessment of the NTL response should be recorded by the investigator.  This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine and record overall response for NTL at the investigational site at each visit.

Not Applicable If the participant had no NTL at baseline. To achieve \u2018unequivocal progression' on the basis of NTL, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest \u2018increase' in the size of 1 or more NTL is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. New Lesions Details of any new soft tissue lesions will also be recorded with the date of assessment.  The presence of 1 or more new lesions is assessed as progression. A lesion identified at a follow up assessment in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumour. If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumour assessments should be continued until the new lesion has been confirmed.  If repeat scans confirm there is a new lesion, then the progression date should be declared using the date of the initial scan. Evaluation of Overall Visit Soft Tissue Response The overall visit response will be derived using the algorithm shown in Table 21.

          "Text":"E 3  ASSESSMENT OF BONE LESION PROGRESSION USING PCWG3 CRITERIA A modified version of PCWG3 will be used in this study.  The deviation from the PCWG3 guideline is that for all visits after the first scan post-baseline; no confirmatory scan is requested to assess PD.  Bone lesions will be assessed by bone scan and will not be part of the RECIST v1.1 malignant soft tissue assessment. Method of Assessment Bone lesions identified on a whole-body isotopic bone scan at baseline should be recorded and followed by the same method as per baseline assessment. In Study D361BC00001, isotopic bone scans will be used as a method of assessment to identify the presence of new bone lesions at follow-up visits.  New lesions will be recorded where a positive and unequivocal hot-spot that was not present on the baseline bone scan assessment is identified on a bone scan performed at any time during the study.  The investigator should consider the positive hot-spot to be a significant new site of malignant disease and represent true disease progression in order to record the new lesion. Tumour Progression Evaluation Schedule of the Evaluation Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before the start of study treatment.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) after randomisation until objective disease progression assessed by investigator as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) or PCWG3 (bone). If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their originally scheduled visits.  This schedule is to be followed in order to minimise any unintentional bias caused by some participants being assessed at a different frequency than other participants. Documentation of Lesions All bone lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified at baseline.  Their status should be followed at subsequent visits.  At each visit an overall assessment of the bone lesion progression should be recorded by the investigator.  This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine and record bone progression at the investigational site at each visit. Progression on a bone scan is identified using modified PCWG3 criteria, by having 2 or more new metastatic bone lesions: For patients without progression at the first visit after baseline, the scan from this first visit after baseline now serves as new reference for all subsequent scans, ie, assuming all visits are acquired according to schedule all bone scans after Week 16 are compared to the Week 16 scan. The requirements for determination and confirmation of radiographic progression by either bone scan (bone progression) or CT\/MRI (soft tissue progression) are summarised in Table 22.

It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. During the course of the study the investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry.  The investigator is responsible for determining whether a participant meets potential PHL criteria at any point during the study. All sources of laboratory data are appropriate for the determination of PHL and HL events; this includes samples taken at scheduled study visits and other visits including central and all local laboratory evaluations even if collected outside of the study visits; for example, PHL criteria could be met by an elevated ALT from a central laboratory and\/or elevated TBL from a local laboratory. The investigator will also review Adverse Event data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevations in liver biochemistry) for possible PHL events. The investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy's Law (HL) criteria are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP). The investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL\/HL cases and for reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events (AEs) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes.

For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur."

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a deterioration of a pre-existing medical occurrence.

Malignant tumours that - as part of normal, if rare, progression - undergo transformation (eg, Richter's transformation of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia into diffuse large B cell lymphoma) should not be considered a new malignant tumour. Life-threatening \u2018Life-threatening' means that the participant was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred, or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the participant's death.  \u2018Life-threatening' does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure). Hospitalisation Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospital admissions and\/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the participant was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study. Important Medical Event or Medical Treatment Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situations where important medical events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death, hospitalisation, disability or incapacity but may jeopardise the participant or may require medical treatment to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.  These should usually be considered as serious. Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical judgement must be used. Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone treatment Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N-acetylcysteine Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation Development of drug dependency or drug abuse Intensity Rating Scale The grading scales found in the revised National Cancer Institute CTCAE latest version will be utilised for all events with an assigned CTCAE grading.  For those events without assigned CTCAE grades, the recommendation in the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, moderate and severe events into CTCAE grades should be used.  A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program website (http:\/\/ctep.cancer.gov).  The applicable version of CTCAE should be described clearly. It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Appendix H 2.  An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Appendix H 2.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix H 2."

          "Text":"H 3  A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question When making an assessment of causality consider the following factors when deciding if there is a \u2018reasonable possibility' that an AE may have been caused by the drug. Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the participant actually received the suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug? Consistency with known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological properties? De-challenge experience.  Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect drug? No alternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors. Re-challenge experience.  Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge. Laboratory tests.  A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship. In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: Is this a recognised feature of overdose of the drug? Is there a known mechanism? Causality of \u2018related' is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a \u2018reasonable possibility' of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expression \u2018reasonable possibility' of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough information to make an informed judgment.  With no available facts or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, the event(s) will be assessed as \u2018not related'. Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility. H 4  Medication Error For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study drug that either causes harm to the participant or has the potential to cause harm to the participant. A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or participant. Medication error includes situations where an error. occurred was identified and intercepted before the participant received the drug did not occur, but circumstances were recognised that could have led to an error Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors: Drug name confusion Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to the participant Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of administration Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet dissolved in water when it should be taken as a solid tablet Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature Wrong participant received the medication (excluding IWRS errors) Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IWRS errors) Examples of events that do not require reporting as medication errors in clinical studies: Errors related to or resulting from IWRS - including those which lead to one of the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error Participant accidentally missed drug dose(s) eg, forgot to take medication Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose) Participant failed to return unused medication or empty packaging None Capivasertib (AZD5363) Errors related to background and rescue medication, or standard of care medication in open label studies, even if an AstraZeneca product Medication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the medication error.  Appendix I  Handling of Human Biological Samples I 1  Chain of Custody A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle. The investigator at each centre keeps full traceability of collected biological samples from the participants while in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate) and records relevant processing information related to the samples whilst at site. The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps record of receipt of arrival and onward shipment or disposal. AstraZeneca or delegated representatives will keep oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring of study sites, auditing or process checks, and contractual requirements of external laboratory providers. Samples retained for further use will be stored in the AstraZeneca-assigned biobanks or other sample archive facilities and will be tracked by the appropriate AstraZeneca Team during for the remainder of the sample life cycle. If required, AstraZeneca will ensure that remaining biological samples are returned to the site according to local regulations or at the end of the retention period, whichever is the sooner. Procedures for biobanking samples as described above will be not applicable to China, and all residual sample from testing in China will be managed as per all applicable local regulations."

Category A pathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus.  Infectious substances meeting these criteria which cause disease in humans or both in humans and animals must be assigned to UN 2814.  Infectious substances which cause disease only in animals must be assigned to UN 2900: Category B Infectious Substances are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in Category A.  Category B pathogens are eg, Hepatitis A, C, D, and E viruses.  They are assigned the following UN number and proper shipping name UN 3373 - Biological Substance, Category B are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650 Exempt - Substances which do not contain infectious substances or substances which are unlikely to cause disease in humans or animals are not subject to these Regulations unless they meet the criteria for inclusion in another class.

Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods specification for the dry-ice content Appendix J  Optional Genomics Initiative Sample J 1  Use\/analysis of DNA AstraZeneca intends to collect and store DNA for genetic research to explore how genetic variations may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis of diseases, and the response to medications.  This genetic research may lead to better understanding of diseases, better diagnosis of diseases or other improvements in health care and to the discovery of new diagnostics, treatments or medications.  Therefore, where local regulations and IRB\/IEC allow, a blood sample will be collected for DNA analysis from consenting participants. This optional genetic research may consist of the analysis of the structure of the participant's DNA, ie, the entire genome. The results of genetic analyses may be reported in a separate study summary. The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality. The samples will be retained while research on capivasertib continues but no longer than 15 years or other period as per local requirements."

          "Text":"J 2  Genetic Research Plan and Procedures Selection of Genetic Research Population All participants will be asked to participate in this genetic research, except for China participants.  Samples for genomics initiative research will not be collected for participants in China.  Participation is voluntary and if a participant declines to participate there will be no penalty or loss of benefit.  The participant will not be excluded from any aspect of the main study. Inclusion Criteria For inclusion in this genetic research, participants must fulfil all of the inclusion criteria described in the main body of the Clinical Study Protocol and: Provide informed consent for the Genomics Initiative sampling and analyses. Exclusion Criteria Exclusion from this genetic research may be for any of the exclusion criteria specified in the main study or any of the following: Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion in 120 days of genetic sample collection Withdrawal of Consent for Genetic Research Participants may withdraw from this genetic research at any time, independent of any decision concerning participation in other aspects of the main study.  Voluntary withdrawal will not prejudice further treatment.  Procedures for withdrawal are outlined in Section 7.2 of the main Clinical Study Protocol. Collection of Samples for Genetic Research A 6 mL blood sample for this genetic research will be obtained from the participants pre-dose on Cycle 1, Day 1, after randomisation.  Although DNA is stable, early sample collection is preferred to avoid introducing bias through excluding participants who may withdraw due to an adverse event (AE).  If for any reason the sample is not drawn at Cycle 1, Day 1, it may be taken at any visit until the last study visit.  Only one sample should be collected per participant for genetics during the study. Coding and Storage of DNA Samples The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genetic analysis are important to maintain participant confidentiality.  Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years, from the date of last participant last visit, after which they will be destroyed.  DNA is a finite resource that is used up during analyses.  Samples will be stored and used until no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached. An additional second code will be assigned to the sample either before or at the time of DNA extraction replacing the information on the sample tube.  Thereafter, the sample will be identifiable only by the second, unique number.  This number is used to identify the sample and corresponding data at the AstraZeneca genetics laboratories, or at the designated organisation.  No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any person (AstraZeneca employee or designated organisations working with the DNA). The link between the participant enrolment\/randomisation code and the second number will be maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at AstraZeneca or designated organisations.  The link will be used to identify the relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitate correlation of genotypic results with clinical data, allow regulatory audit, and permit tracing of samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of consent. Ethical and Regulatory Requirements The principles for ethical and regulatory requirements for the study, including this genetics research component, are outlined in Appendix B. Informed Consent The genetic component of this study is optional and the participant may participate in other components of the main study without participating in this genetic component.  To participate in the genetic component of the study the participant must sign and date both the consent form for the main study and the addendum for the Genomics Initiative component of the study.  Copies of both signed and dated consent forms must be given to the participant and the original filed at the study centre.  The Principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is given freely and that the participant understands that they may freely withdrawal from the genetic aspect of the study at any time. Participant Data Protection AstraZeneca will not provide individual genotype results to participants, any insurance company, any employer, their family members, general physician unless required to do so by law. Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked to the identity of the participant.  In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a participant.  For example, in the case of a medical emergency, an AstraZeneca Physician or an investigator might know a participant's identity and also have access to his or her genetic data.  Regulatory authorities may require access to the relevant files, though the participant's medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate. Data Management Any genetic data generated in this study will be stored at a secure system at AstraZeneca and\/or designated organisations to analyse the samples. AstraZeneca and its designated organisations may share summary results (such as genetic differences from groups of individuals with a disease) from this genetic research with other researchers, such as hospitals, academic organisations, or health insurance companies.  This can be done by placing the results in scientific databases, where they can be combined with the results of similar studies to learn even more about health and disease.  The researchers can only use this information for health-related research purposes.  Researchers may see summary results, but they will not be able to see individual participant data or any personal identifiers. Some or all of the clinical datasets from the main study may be merged with the genetic data in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database."

The modality of the cardiac function assessments must be consistent within subject ie, if echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment and a follow-up assessment if clinically indicated, then echocardiogram should also be used for subsequent scans.  Participants should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible. c Participants will be required to provide the most recently collected tumour sample (bone metastases or Fine Needle Aspirate [FNA] samples will not be accepted), collected as part of routine clinical practice.  Availability of a tumour sample is mandatory for all patients to enrol in the study for the determination of PTEN status by IHC.  A representative FFPE tissue block that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides must be provided, or, if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual and Pathology Testing Manual.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1; no additional slides will be collected for screening Part 1 or Part 2. d Optional tumour sample: FFPE block (preferred) or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections can be provided.  These slides will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/ or diagnostic test development.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual and Pathology Testing Manual. e Not applicable for China participants. f Eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) are required to provide an additional tumour sample FFPE block (preferred) or 20 (minimum 15) freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  This sample will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/or diagnostic test development.  Patients who provided optional tissue in screening Part 1 are exempt from this requirement.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. g Blood sample for determination of PSA.  Mandatory for all participants on study.  Samples to be collected both at screening and at Cycle 1, Day 1. h Tumour assessment will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a whole-body bone scan.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before randomisation, and ideally should be performed as close as possible to the start of study treatment. i BPI-SF and BFI baseline assessments to be completed by the participant in a consecutive 7-day period during screening (only after PTEN deficiency is confirmed) before randomisation (not required to be at site). j In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs\/SAEs must be reported.

None j Where possible and with consent, participants may be requested to provide a tumour biopsy at tumour progression. k Tumour assessment will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a whole-body bone scan.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) relative to the date of randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), regardless of discontinuation of study treatment (eg, discontinuation due to toxicity or clinical progression) or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy.  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged.  If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at the participant's scheduled visits.  It is important to follow the imaging assessment schedule as closely as possible; however, tumour assessment can be performed at any time when disease progression is clinically suspected.  For participants who have at least 2 new bone lesions appearing on the first post-baseline scan, confirmation of progression will be required by an additional bone scan showing 2 or more new lesions compared to the first post-baseline bone scan at least 6 weeks later (for further detail please see Appendix E). l For the BPI-SF and BFI, the C1D1 assessment is part of the 7-day diaries completed at screening (see Table 1). m The PRO-CTCAE will only be administered where a linguistically validated version exists for a country. n In addition to regular contacts at 12-week intervals, participants will be contacted in the 7 days following a specified date (data cut-off date) for survival analysis. o Participants will enter the PFS2 follow-up period once the participant has discontinued study treatment due to progressive disease by RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue lesions and\/or PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions.  In the survival follow-up period following PFS, all subsequent cancer therapies and vital status will be documented at least every 12 weeks until death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first.

None 2  INTRODUCTION Capivasertib (AZD5363), a novel pyrrolopyrimidine-derived compound, is a potent, selective inhibitor of the kinase activity of all 3 isoforms of AKT (Davies et al 2012).  AstraZeneca is developing capivasertib for use in combination with other anticancer agents for a range of therapeutic indications, including prostate cancer and breast cancer. The AKT serine\/threonine protein kinases (AKT1, AKT2, AKT3) are key downstream effectors of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway, mediating cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, and are activated in a wide range of malignancies (Lindsley 2010).  AKT activation in tumours is largely due to input from other signalling pathways upstream of AKT, including loss of PTEN function and mutations in the catalytic subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) (Yi and Lauring 2015). Investigators should be familiar with the current capivasertib Investigator's Brochure (IB). 2.1  Study Rationale This Phase 3 study is designed to compare capivasertib versus placebo, administered in combination with abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) and ADT as a treatment in patients with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC with tumour tissue characterised by PTEN deficiency.  The rationale for conducting the study is supported by the following: The important unmet medical need in this setting The capivasertib mechanism of action and nonclinical data with capivasertib Clinical data from a study with ipatasertib, an AKT inhibitor with a similar mechanism of action to capivasertib, given in combination with abiraterone in patients with prostate cancer. The background to the rationale is summarised below in Section 2.2. 2.2  Background Prostate cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer in men and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.  An estimated 1.3 million men worldwide were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018, accounting for 13% of the cancers diagnosed in men.  With an estimated 358,989 deaths in 2018, prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of death from cancer in men (6.7% of the total deaths from cancer in men) (Globocan 2018). In the advanced disease setting, ADT with either orchiectomy or medical castration with GnRH analogues is highly effective in shrinking tumour burden, decreasing PSA levels, and enhancing quality of life.  Recent studies demonstrated the benefits (including improved survival) in patients with mHSPC of adding docetaxel (Gravis et al 2016, James et al 2016, Sweeney et al 2015) or the androgen biosynthesis inhibitor abiraterone (Fizazi et al 2017, James et al 2017, Mottet et al 2018) to ADT.  Other NHAs, enzalutamide and apalutamide, have also demonstrated benefit in this population (Armstrong et al 2019, Chi et al 2019, Davis et al 2019).  Unfortunately, despite the benefits of these combination therapies, mHSPC inevitably progresses to a castration-resistant phenotype, which is not yet curable, with 90% of overall mortality attributable to the underlying malignant disease (Scher et al 2015). Patients with de novo mHSPC are at higher risk of progressing to a castration-resistant disease state than those with prostate cancer that has progressed to metastasis after treatment for what was initially localised or locally advanced disease (referred to as \u2018recurrent mHSPC'), as demonstrated by shorter median OS and time to castration resistance (Francini et al 2018, Francini et al 2019, Gravis et al 2015).  In addition, loss of PTEN gene expression in prostate cancer is associated with features of more aggressive disease and poor prognosis; patients with PTEN loss at diagnosis have increased risk of recurrence and poorer survival (Ahearn et al 2015, Chaux et al 2012, Cuzick et al 2013, Lotan et al 2016, Reid et al 2010).  Thus, there is an important unmet medical need for treatments in the de novo mHSPC setting that are able to delay cancer progression and ultimately, death, particularly in patients whose tumours are characterised by PTEN deficiency. In nonclinical studies, capivasertib inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines that represent both hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant disease settings (Davies et al 2012, Liu and Dong 2014, Marques et al 2015).  Single-agent capivasertib also inhibited the growth of both androgen-dependent and castrate-resistant prostate tumour xenograft models (Thomas et al 2013), genetically engineered prostate tumours (De Velasco et al 2016), and patient-derived xenografts (Marques et al 2015).  Sensitivity to capivasertib correlated with loss of PTEN expression.  Inhibition of tumour growth in prostate tumour models with PI3K pathway inhibitors and specifically with capivasertib alone resulted in upregulation of the AR and AR-mediated gene expression (Carver et al 2011, Mulholland et al 2011, Thomas et al 2013, Marques et al 2015).  Since the AR and PI3K\/AKT pathways cross regulate one another through reciprocal feedback (Carver et al 2011, Mulholland et al 2011), the combined inhibition of AKT and the AR axis in prostate cancer may provide greater benefit than targeting either pathway alone. These nonclinical data for capivasertib are supported by the results of the Phase II randomised ASTON MARTIN study with ipatasertib, an AKT inhibitor with a similar mechanism of action to capivasertib.  The results showed that ipatasertib given in combination with abiraterone prolonged rPFS compared with abiraterone alone in patients with mCRPC and PTEN-deficient tumours.  In the ITT population, median rPFS was 8.2 months for the ipatasertib 400 mg group compared with 6.4 months for placebo: HR, 0.75 (90% CI: 0.54, 1.05).  In the PTEN-deficient group, median rPFS was 11.5 months on ipatasertib 400 mg compared with 4.6 months on placebo: HR, 0.39 (90% CI: 0.22, 0.70) (de Bono et al 2019).  The combination of ipatasertib and abiraterone is under evaluation in mCRPC in an ongoing Phase 3 study (NCT03072238), which is now fully enrolled. A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of capivasertib is provided in the IB. 2.3  Benefit-Risk Assessment 2.3.1  Risk Assessment Based on nonclinical and clinical data available to date, the risks associated with capivasertib are as follows: Identified Risks: nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, dry skin, pruritus, decreased appetite Important Identified Risks: diarrhoea, rash, hyperglycaemia, hypersensitivity Important Potential Risk: QT prolongation Overall, in the monotherapy intermittent dosage pool of patients in previous studies (n = 229), 42.4% of the 229 patients had SAEs, 17% of the 229 had causally related SAEs, and 3.1% were reported with SAEs leading to death.  There were no capivasertib treatment-related deaths in this pool.  A total of 17.5% patients were discontinued due to AEs, and a total of 11.4% were discontinued due to AEs that were considered related to capivasertib treatment. Diarrhoea As of the data cut-off (DCO) date of October 2019, diarrhoea (all grades) has been observed in 79.9% of patients on capivasertib monotherapy (intermittent dosing); most (84%) of these events have been of Grade 2 or lower, managed by dose modifications and supportive care (eg, loperamide), and have only resulted in a 1.3% incidence of drug discontinuation. Hyperglycaemia Hyperglycaemia has been observed with AKT inhibitors.  AKT inhibitor-induced hyperglycaemia is associated with induction of liver glycogenolysis as well as reduction in peripheral glucose uptake.  This effect may be exaggerated by steroid therapy which is co-administered with abiraterone.  Based on currently available data from AstraZeneca-sponsored studies, hyperglycaemia due to capivasertib tends to be transient and reversible on cessation of treatment.  There is a trend of an increase in plasma glucose levels peaking at approximately 4 hours post-dose, generally returning towards baseline levels at 8 hours and beyond.  Dose discontinuations due to AEs of hyperglycaemia were uncommon in previous studies (0.9% of patients).  There were no data to suggest that the transient hyperglycaemia associated with capivasertib treatment had clinically important consequences. Patients with Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes who require insulin treatment, and\/or patients who have glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) \u2265 8.0% (63.9 mmol\/mol) at screening, will be excluded from the study.  Fasting glucose and HbA1c will be monitored throughout the study.  Hyperglycaemia will be mitigated by dose modifications as per toxicity management guidelines, including administration of antidiabetic agents (eg, metformin) when required. Potential Effect on QT Interval Inhibition of the PI3K signalling pathway has been identified as a potential cause of drug-induced long QT syndrome via an inhibition of cardiac potassium currents (IKr, IKs) and an increase of the cardiac late sodium current.  Based on nonclinical data available, QT prolongation has been noted as important potential risk with capivasertib.  QT prolongation has been observed with ADT.  The clinical data available to date do not support any clinically relevant trend of QT prolongation.  Based on a concentration-response modelling analysis, the estimated mean QTcF change from baseline was 4.0 ms (90% CI: 2.9, 5.1 ms) at the therapeutic dose (400 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off) and steady state geometric mean Cmax, which gives an approximate 4- to 5-fold margin to the level of regulatory concern for oncology drugs (20 ms) (Garnett et al 2018).  In AstraZeneca-sponsored clinical studies with capivasertib, there were no reports of sudden death, torsades de pointes, or seizures.  Further details on the risks are available in Section 6 of the IB \u2018Summary of data and guidance for the investigators'.  The study eligibility criteria take into account a potential impact on QT interval.  GnRH analogues\/ADT are known to be associated with QTc prolongation. Ongoing Phase Ib Study D3618C00002 Capivasertib is being evaluated in combination with abiraterone and GnRH analogues in an ongoing Phase Ib study (D3618C00002) in patients with mCRPC.  Following review of the starting dose of capivasertib (400 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off) in combination with standard dose abiraterone (+ prednisone), the study's safety review committee concluded that there were no dose-limiting toxicities observed to preclude further study of the combination at this dose level (see Section 4.3). Externally-Sponsored Research Studies There are 17 externally-sponsored research studies with capivasertib ongoing, completed, or terminated.  Of these 17, 8 are investigating capivasertib specifically and a further 9 are \u201cumbrella\/basket\u201d studies in which capivasertib is an option in a panel of investigational drugs.  Key safety information reported to AstraZeneca by externally-sponsored research sponsors has been incorporated in the IB. 2.3.2  Benefit Assessment Hormonal therapy targeting the androgen axis remains the mainstay of initial treatment for mHSPC and typically gives rapid disease response and control; however, resistance to hormonal therapies inevitably occurs with time and the cancer starts to progress. PTEN-deficient prostate cancer is associated with higher Gleason score, tumour stage, and poorer prognosis.  The AR and PI3K\/AKT signalling networks cross regulate each other, and the combination of capivasertib with an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor is anticipated to enhance efficacy in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer.  Clinical and nonclinical data with capivasertib support the hypothesis that AKT inhibition may be a valid treatment strategy for mHSPC.  Capivasertib has demonstrated clinical activity in several settings including patients with advanced AKT1 mutant solid tumours as monotherapy or in combination with other agents.  The experimental agent ipatasertib has the same mode of action, and in a randomised Phase II study (ASTON MARTIN) in patients with CRPC, demonstrated meaningful improvement in rPFS when added to abiraterone and ADT (de Bono et al 2019). 2.3.3  Overall Benefit-Risk Conclusion The emerging safety profile of capivasertib from nonclinical and early clinical studies has not identified risks that would preclude investigation in this setting.  The study design aims to minimise potential risks in several ways.  First, the protocol includes safety monitoring in excess of standard of care monitoring, with the intent of protecting participants involved in the study.  Furthermore, investigators will be provided with a safety management strategy for the management of key toxicities, and monitoring is in place for those risks deemed to be most likely or serious.  Thus, based upon the clinical and nonclinical safety profile of capivasertib, the limited life expectancy due to malignant disease, and the strength of the scientific hypothesis under evaluation, the benefit-risk assessment for this study supports treatment with capivasertib given in addition to standard androgen suppression therapy in the form of abiraterone and LHRH analogue\/surgical castration in patients with mHSPC. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected AEs of capivasertib may be found in the IB. 3  OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS"

Participants will be recruited globally from approximately 30 countries and approximately 350 study sites in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and Asia (including China and Japan). Approximately 5500 participants will be enrolled and screened to achieve a total of 1000 randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 treatment arms.  For regulatory submission purposes in China, the study will include approximately 150 randomised participants from sites in mainland China and those from Taiwan and Hong Kong accredited by the National Medical Product Administration (NMPA). Screening will be conducted in a 2-part process (see Figure 2), which must be completed within a 3-month period between the participant starting ADT and being randomised to study treatment.  In the 3-month period between screening Part 1 and randomisation, participants may be receiving abiraterone as well as ADT.  Part 1 will include those eligibility criteria marked with an asterisk (*) in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, and testing for PTEN status.  In Part 2, all remaining screening assessments will be performed, and must be completed within 28 days before randomisation.  The assessments to be performed at screening are shown in the SoA (Table 1). Figure 2  Two-part Screening Process None Table 1 shows the assessments to be completed in screening Parts 1 and 2. Eligible participants will have histologically confirmed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma, without small-cell features.  PTEN status is confirmed by IHC via central testing of tumour tissue using an Investigational Use Only (IUO) assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, USA).  For screening Part 1, patients are required to provide a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour sample, collected as part of routine clinical practice, for central testing.  This should preferably be a tissue block that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides, or if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides from the same block.  In addition, for screening Part 1 an optional tumour sample (FFPE block [preferred] or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections) can be provided.  These slides will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/or diagnostic test development.  Participants who provide this optional sample in Part 1 do not need to provide additional tumour sample for screening Part 2.  For screening Part 2, eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) will be required to provide an additional tumour sample FFPE block (preferred) or 20 (minimum 15) freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  This sample will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/or diagnostic test development.  Further details on tissue specifications are outlined in the Laboratory Manual and the Pathology Testing Manual as well as in Section 8.6.1.  A patient cannot be randomised until a valid, central laboratory tested PTEN IHC result indicates PTEN deficiency.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1; no additional slides will be collected for screening Part 2. Blood samples for analysis of ctDNA and other circulating biomarkers will also be collected and analysed (not applicable for China patients). Approximately 1000 participants will be randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive either capivasertib or placebo, in combination with abiraterone on a background of ADT.  It is expected that approximately 5500 potential participants will be screened.  The screen failure rate is estimated on the following assumptions: PTEN deficiency prevalence of 21% (screen failure rate of 79%), as well as a further 15% screen failure for other reasons (eg, informed consent\/ eligibility criteria\/PTEN IHC test failure rate).  Participants will receive oral treatment with capivasertib or placebo BD (4 days on and 3 days off) until progression or discontinuation.  Participants will also receive the approved oral dose of abiraterone (1000 mg once daily) with 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone daily.  All participants should also receive continuous ADT using either a LHRH agonist, a LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy. The randomisation scheme will be stratified on the following factors: Combination of volume of disease according to CHAARTED criteria and presence of visceral metastases (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease) Geographic location: North America, Western Europe, and Australia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and Asia. High volume disease is defined as the presence of either visceral metastases (or \u2265 4 bone metastases with \u2265 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis (Sweeney et al 2015).  For the purposes of this study, visceral metastases are defined by the list provided within the IWRS. An IDMC will assess the progress of the study at regular intervals.  This will include reviewing unblinded safety and tolerability data and the data from the interim efficacy analysis to provide a recommendation to AstraZeneca as to whether the study should continue unchanged, be stopped, or be modified in any way. Section 6.7 describes treatment intervention after the end of the study. 4.2  Scientific Rationale for Study Design Choice of Background Therapy At the time of initiation of this study, the Category 1 recommended treatment options for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer in the US include ADT in combination with docetaxel, abiraterone (+ prednisone), apalutamide, or enzalutamide, since these combinations have all reported OS improvement over ADT alone in randomised Phase III studies in this setting (NCCN 2019).  Alternatives include ADT with addition of radiation therapy (for low volume mHSPC) or ADT with abiraterone with methylprednisolone (Category 2B).  The European Association of Urology (EAU) treatment guidelines currently recommend a choice between abiraterone and chemotherapy as systemic treatment in addition to a background of ADT, irrespective of risk status (EAU guidelines 2019).  In patients with previously untreated mHSPC, docetaxel or abiraterone treatment resulted in an OS of 57.6 and 53.3 months respectively, and patients progress to mCRPC on average 33 months after start of treatment Fizazi et al 2017, Sweeney et al 2015).  Since mHSPC patients inevitably progress to a castration-resistant phenotype, therapeutic interventions that are able to delay the time to disease progression would address an important unmet medical need.  Although currently incurable, the disease is more amenable to intervention and a targeted treatment approach may bring additional benefits over AR-based treatments alone (Fizazi et al 2017). There is an increasing focus on the development of molecularly-targeted agents for individualised treatment in prostate cancer, eg, PARP inhibitors in patients with DNA repair pathway alteration (Mateo et al 2015, Mateo et al 2019, Hussain et al 2019).  Activation of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway is common in prostate cancer, predominantly due to PTEN loss (Robinson et al 2015, Abida et al 2017), and there is a reciprocal relationship between this pathway and the AR pathway, such that inhibition of one leads to upregulation of the other (Carver et al 2011).  Of note, PTEN loss has been shown to be an indicator of poor prognosis in prostate cancer; PTEN loss was associated with early biochemical recurrence, extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle involvement, and poorer cause-specific and overall survival, based on samples predominantly from patients with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer (Krohn et al 2012, Reid et al 2010, Troyer et al 2015). Evidence from clinical studies is emerging for the benefits of AKT inhibition in combination with abiraterone in the treatment of prostate cancer; eg, the Phase II ASTON MARTIN study of ipatasertib in combination with abiraterone in patients with mCRPC prolonged rPFS compared with abiraterone alone, especially in patients with PTEN-deficient tumours: median rPFS was 11.5 versus 4.6 months (de Bono et al 2019).  Since the proof of concept for AKT inhibition in a metastatic prostate cancer setting was obtained for ipatasertib in combination with abiraterone, enrolment into the present study is restricted to patients for whom abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) plus ADT is considered the optimal treatment approach by the treating investigator; patients requiring another treatment modality such as docetaxel or radiotherapy are not eligible. In summary, although abiraterone is an approved therapy and is a recommended treatment option for patients with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC in current evidence-based guidelines, there is still a significant unmet medical need in this population.  In particular, patients with PTEN-deficient tumours may experience improved treatment outcomes from the addition of a molecularly targeted agent, including those that specifically inhibit the PI3K\/AKT pathway.  Therefore, addition of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib to standard abiraterone therapy could improve treatment outcomes in mHSPC patients with PTEN-deficient tumours and delay the development of castration resistance. Abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA\u00ae) is converted in vivo to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor.  Specifically, abiraterone selectively inhibits the enzyme 17\u03b1 hydroxylase\/C17,20 lyase (CYP17).  This enzyme is expressed in, and is required for, androgen biosynthesis in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumour tissues.  CYP17 catalyses the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone into testosterone precursors, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione, respectively, by 17\u03b1-hydroxylation and cleavage of the C17,20 bond.  CYP17 inhibition also results in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals.  Abiraterone was first approved (in combination with prednisone) for the treatment of mCRPC.  The indication has since been extended to include the treatment of newly diagnosed high-risk mHSPC (ZYTIGA Prescribing Information 2019, Zytiga SmPC 2019). The approval of abiraterone in mHSPC was supported by 2 large randomised controlled studies demonstrating the survival and other patient-relevant benefits of abiraterone given in addition to ADT: STAMPEDE (Arm G) (James et al 2017) and LATITUDE (Fizazi et al 2017, Fizazi et al 2019).  The LATITUDE study (unlike STAMPEDE) required all participants to have high-risk mHSPC, defined by having at least 2 of the following: Gleason score of \u2265 8, \u2265 3 bone metastases, or the presence of visceral metastases.  The reduction in the risk of death was nearly identical between the two studies, with a HR of 0.62, also confirmed in a meta-analysis.  Furthermore, post hoc analyses of STAMPEDE demonstrated that abiraterone achieved positive outcomes in men with mHSPC (including rPFS and OS) regardless of low or high burden of disease.  The definition of \u2018low volume' versus \u2018high volume' disease was based on the CHAARTED criteria (presence of either visceral metastases or > 3 bone metastases).  Risk status (\u2018low risk' vs \u2018high risk') was defined using the LATITUDE criteria (Hoyle et al 2019; Sweeney et al 2015, Fizazi et al 2017).  In addition to the effects on failure-free survival and OS in STAMPEDE, significant benefits of add-on abiraterone were also seen for PROs in LATITUDE, including progression of pain, prostate cancer symptoms, fatigue, functional decline, and overall HRQoL (Chi et al 2018). Based on the studies and clinical practice guidelines discussed above, abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) plus ADT combination therapy currently is a recommended standard-of-care first-line option for the treatment of men with de novo mHSPC, irrespective of risk status or disease volume (EAU guidelines 2019, Mottet et al 2018, NCCN 2019, Parker et al 2015, Parker et al 2017). Study Population The study population is associated with considerable unmet medical need, as described in Section 2.2. The rationale for the inclusion of participants with mHSPC without high-risk features in this study is based on the analyses from the STAMPEDE study, which demonstrated that abiraterone achieved positive efficacy outcomes for both rPFS and OS in the target patient population, regardless of risk status (James et al 2017).  In addition, as noted above, classifying patients with prostate cancer for treatment based on risk status is not distinguished within treatment guidelines, and is not routinely done in the clinic. Only adenocarcinomas without small-cell histology are allowed; this is consistent with the LATITUDE study (Fizazi et al 2017), which was the primary basis for the approval of abiraterone in mHSPC. The presence of metastatic disease will be confirmed using standard imaging techniques that are widely used in the staging of prostate cancer in routine clinical practice, with RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 principles adopted for assessment of metastatic lesions. Only patients with ECOG performance status 0 or 1 are eligible, in line with guidelines recommending that abiraterone should be offered only to patients with ECOG status 0 or 1. The use of mild opioid analgesics for cancer-related pain, bisphosphonates and denosumab for management of bone-related metastases, LHRH analogues (ie, ADT) to maintain testosterone < 50 ng\/dL, conventional multivitamins and selenium, prednisone dose increases and eplerenone to manage refractory mineralocorticoid-related toxicities, transfusions and haematopoietic growth factors will all be permitted during the study.  However, where possible, these will be kept at a stable dose to allow accurate characterisation of the capivasertib treatment effect. Stratification Factors The randomisation scheme will be stratified based a combination of volume of disease and presence of visceral metastases, and also geographic location (as described in Section 4.1). Volume of disease as determined by the CHAARTED criteria is considered a key prognostic factor in prostate cancer.  High volume disease is defined as the presence of visceral metastases or \u2265 4 bone lesions with \u2265 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis.  Although abiraterone has been shown to provide benefit to patients with mHSPC in each risk status and volume subgroup, the overall prognosis as measured by median failure-free survival, PFS, and OS was markedly shorter in patients with high disease volume (Hoyle et al 2019).  This prognostic effect is further supported by analyses of other agents in mHSPC (Sweeney et al 2015, Stenzl et al 2019). Presence of visceral metastases is a known prognostic factor in prostate cancer and was incorporated into both the LATITUDE risk and CHAARTED disease volume criteria.  However, visceral tumour sites (eg, lung and liver metastases) were shown to be independently related to worse prognosis in a meta-analysis of 8802 men with prostate cancer (Halabi at al 2016).  The combination of volume of disease (high versus low) according to CHAARTED criteria and presence of visceral metastases results in a stratification factor with 3 levels (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease), as according to the definition, patients with low disease volume would not have visceral metastases.  For the purposes of this study, visceral metastases are defined by the list provided within the IWRS. The geographic split of Western Europe, Australia plus United States, Latin America plus Eastern Europe, and Asia was chosen to account for possible differences in PSA screening, and healthcare accessibility and quality in different regions that could affect both the primary treatment outcome and post study (eg, OS) endpoints. Study Endpoints The definition of rPFS (see Section 8.1.2.1) is considered to be consistent with EMA guidance in the prostate cancer-specific appendix to the Guideline on the Evaluation of Anticancer Medicinal Products in Man (EMA 2015) which recognises PFS as an acceptable primary endpoint.  PFS is also listed in the FDA's table of surrogate endpoints and has supported prior approvals in prostate cancer (FDA 2019).  Reducing the risk of radiographic progression is of clinical importance given the strong positive correlation reported for PFS and OS in patients with mCRPC.  Also, a recent study of enzalutamide in patients with mHSPC (ARCHES; Armstrong et al 2019) which was the basis of the recent FDA approval and positive opinion adopted by the CHMP for this indication, utilised rPFS as the primary endpoint.  The Phase III study supporting the FDA approval of apalutamide used rPFS as a dual primary endpoint (with OS) (Chi et al 2019). The median OS for the mHSPC patient population treated with ADT and abiraterone is over 5 years.  It is considered that an unfeasibly large and long study (more than 4000 patients and a study duration of over 11 years) would be required to obtain sufficient statistical power to detect OS differences in a reasonable timeframe.  However, the study population will be followed up after the primary analysis for rPFS for longer term endpoints, including OS. The key secondary efficacy endpoints for this study have been widely adopted in clinical studies in patients with prostate cancer and overall, are considered to represent the most clinically meaningful events for patients.  Prostate cancer typically metastasises to bone and is associated with risk of pathological fractures, spinal cord compression and severe pain with detrimental impact on quality of life.  Reducing the risk of developing symptomatic skeletal-related events and delaying the onset of pain are considered highly clinically relevant endpoints in the context of prostate cancer. The study includes several PRO endpoints, of which AstraZeneca considers the measurement of pain as the most relevant measure of the patient experience with mHSPC, and will be an alpha-controlled secondary endpoint, defined based on the BPI-SF worst pain (Item 3) and analgesic use.  Additionally, a comprehensive evaluation of fatigue, symptoms, impacts, treatment tolerability, and HRQoL will provide a totality of PRO evidence. 4.3  Justification for Dose Several doses and schedules have been investigated for capivasertib.  In the capivasertib clinical programme as of 04 October 2019 (the DCO for the current IB), approximately 1150 patients had been exposed to capivasertib as monotherapy or in combination with other agents: approximately 480 patients in AstraZeneca-sponsored studies and 672 in Investigator-sponsored studies.  More detailed information may be found in the IB. The recommended regimen for monotherapy (480 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off) was selected based on pharmacodynamic parameters from tumour biopsies, PK data, and clinical safety.  The recommended regimen of capivasertib with paclitaxel or with fulvestrant is 400 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off. Clinical studies with the AKT inhibitor ipatasertib have demonstrated efficacy and favourable tolerability in different tumour types at the same dose (400 mg QD continuously), namely in TNBC with the paclitaxel combination (LOTUS study; Kim et al 2017) and in prostate cancer with the abiraterone combination (ASTON MARTIN Phase II study; de Bono et al 2019). Therefore, the capivasertib dose regimen (400 mg BD, 4 days on, 3 days off), which has demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in randomised Phase II studies in metastatic TNBC (PAKT; Schmid et al 2020) and HR+ advanced breast cancer (FAKTION; Jones et al 2019), is hypothesised to be effective and tolerable also in prostate cancer. Since no major influence of gender or age has been observed on the PK of capivasertib and the risk of PK interactions between capivasertib and abiraterone + prednisone\/prednisolone in combination with GnRH analogues is low, similar systemic exposure is expected in the prostate cancer population as in the breast cancer populations. The conversion of abiraterone acetate to its active metabolite abiraterone is likely through esterase activity and is not CYP-mediated.  Abiraterone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and capivasertib is a direct and time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  However, co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of abiraterone.  Abiraterone has the potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and to a lesser extent CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4\/5.  Capivasertib is primarily metabolised by UGT2B7 and CYP3A4.  In vitro, abiraterone and its major metabolites were shown to inhibit the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1.  There are no clinical data available to confirm transporter-based interactions. Clinically relevant interactions between capivasertib and prednisone\/prednisolone are unlikely.  Drugs which inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of corticosteroids.  The strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%.  However, capivasertib is not a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 based on in vitro results and PBPK simulations.  Glucocorticoids are moderate inducers of CYP3A4, but capivasertib is unlikely to be a sensitive substrate of CYP3A4.  The risk for drug-drug interactions between capivasertib and GnRH analogues is low.  These drugs are peptides, metabolised by peptidases, so it is unlikely that they would be affected by CYP450 inhibitors. The ongoing Phase Ib Study D3618C00002 in patients with mCRPC is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and PK of capivasertib in combination with abiraterone (+ prednisone\/ prednisolone) and GnRH analogues.  After review of the first dose level (400 mg BD, 4 days on, 3 days off) in combination with standard dose abiraterone + prednisone in n=8 patients with heavily pretreated mCPRC, the safety review committee concluded that there were no dose-limiting toxicities observed to preclude further study of the combination at this dose level.  The capivasertib PK was as predicted from previous studies where capivasertib was given as monotherapy.  Thus, the capivasertib dosing regimen of 400 mg BD, 4 days on, 3 days off, is selected for the present study in combination with abiraterone and ADT.  This regimen is also being examined in the Phase 3 breast cancer programme (CAPItello-290\/D3614C00001 and CAPItello-291\/D3615C00001, in combination with paclitaxel or with fulvestrant, respectively). Guidelines for modification of the capivasertib\/placebo dose in the present study are provided in Section 6.6. 4.4  End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study when they have completed all phases of the study including their last scheduled visit or their last scheduled procedure in the SoA (Table 2). The end of the study is defined as the date of last expected visit\/contact of the last participant undergoing the study. 5  STUDY POPULATION Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrolment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted. Following written informed consent, all participants will undergo central PTEN status assessment using the IHC assay (see Section 6.1.2) and initial eligibility criteria review, as defined by the marked criteria (*) in Section 5.1 (inclusion criteria) and Section 5.2 (exclusion criteria), below. 5.1  Inclusion Criteria Participants are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria apply: Age 1  *Participant must be \u2265 18 years of age (\u2265 20 years of age in Japan), at the time of signing the informed consent. Type of Participant and Disease Characteristics *Histologically-confirmed de novo (ie, diagnosed within 3 months of randomisation) metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma.  Note: adenocarcinoma must be the primary histological pattern and patients with small-cell tumours are not eligible. *Consent to provide a FFPE tissue block (preferred) or slides.  Details on tissue requirements are specified in the Laboratory Manual.  Cytologic or FNA samples are not acceptable.  Tumour tissue from bone metastases is not acceptable. *A valid PTEN IHC result indicating PTEN deficiency (centralised testing). Metastatic disease documented prior to randomisation by clear evidence of \u2265 1 bone lesion (defined as 1 lesion with positive uptake on bone scan) and\/or \u2265 1 soft tissue lesion (measurable and\/or non-measurable) that can be accurately assessed at baseline and is suitable for repeated assessment with CT and\/or MRI.  Patients with metastatic disease identified by PSMA PET only, will not be eligible.  Local lymph node involvement is not considered metastatic disease. Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic form of prostate cancer based on the investigator's clinical evaluation. *Candidate for abiraterone and steroid therapy.  Previous treatment with abiraterone and\/or a steroid for de novo disease is allowed up to a maximum of 3 months prior to randomisation (prior treatment with chemotherapy or other NHAs is not allowed). Ongoing ADT with GnRH analogue (combination with first generation androgen receptor antagonists, eg, bicalutamide is allowed), or LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy.  Duration of ongoing ADT (regardless of method) is from 0 days to a maximum of 3 months prior to randomisation. ECOG\/WHO performance status 0 to 1 (see Appendix A) with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks. *Able and willing to swallow and retain oral medication. Participants must complete the 7-day BPI-SF and BFI questionnaires and the analgesic diary during screening (only after PTEN deficiency is confirmed), prior to randomisation.  Note: it is required to give participants at least 7 consecutive days to complete the assessments prior to randomisation.  If a minimum of 4 assessments is not completed during the 7-day period, participants must be re-screened, a new 7 days of questionnaire\/diary entries completed, and any screening tests which are consequently outside of the applicable 28 days prior to randomisation must also be repeated.  Sex *Participants will be male. Reproduction 13  Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm: Sterilisation (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). Participants should use barrier contraception (ie, condoms) from the time of screening until 16 weeks after discontinuation of study drug.  It is not known whether the pre-clinical changes seen in the male animal reproductive organs, after treatment with capivasertib, will be fully reversible or will permanently affect the ability to produce healthy sperm following treatment.  Therefore, if participants wish to father children, they should be advised to arrange for collection of sperm samples prior to the start of study treatment. Informed Consent *Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix B 3, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICF and in this CSP. Provision of signed and dated written Optional Genetic Research Information informed consent prior to collection of samples for optional genetic research that supports Genomic Initiative. 5.2  Exclusion Criteria Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply: Medical Conditions Radiotherapy with a wide field of radiation (eg, more than one-third of the skeleton) within 4 weeks before the start of study treatment (capivasertib\/placebo). Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access, transurethral resection of prostate, bilateral orchiectomy, or internal stents) within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment.

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) if no demonstrable liver metastases or > 5x ULN in the presence of liver metastases.  Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is not exclusionary if due to the presence of bone metastases and liver function is otherwise considered adequate in the investigator's judgement. Total bilirubin > 1.5x ULN (participants with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome may be included in the study with a higher value) Creatinine > 1.5x ULN concurrent with creatinine clearance < 50 mL\/min (measured or calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation); confirmation of creatinine clearance is only required when creatinine is > 1.5x ULN. *As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including active bleeding diatheses, or known active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV.

The clinical relevance of this is unknown, but until further information is available a conservative approach has been taken to recommend that participants fast from at least 2 hours before dosing to at least 1 hour after dosing, where possible.  Water can be allowed as desired. In addition, participants should avoid herbal supplements (eg, St John's wort) and ingestion of large amounts of foods and beverages known to potently modulate CYP3A4 enzyme activity, during study treatment.  For example, no more than half a grapefruit, a small glass of grapefruit juice or 2 teaspoons of Seville orange marmalade should be consumed daily.  Please refer to Appendix C for further guidance. Participants will be required to fast from at least 2 hours before until at least 1 hour after each dose of abiraterone, due to an effect of food on absorption.  Water can be allowed as desired. 5.3.2  Caffeine, Alcohol, and Tobacco No interactions with caffeine, alcohol or tobacco have been identified. 5.3.3  Contraception Participants must use a condom during treatment and for 16 weeks after the last dose of capivasertib when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential.  Female partners of male participants should also use a highly effective form of contraception (as described in Appendix D) if they are of childbearing potential.  Participants should not donate sperm throughout the period of taking capivasertib and for 3 months following the last dose of capivasertib. 5.3.4  Other Restrictions Participants who are blood donors should not donate blood during the study and for 3 months following their last dose of study treatment.  For blood donation after study participation, refer to WHO guidelines (WHO 2012). 5.4  Screen Failures Screen failures are defined as patients who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently randomised.  A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities.  Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any SAE.  If a patient is ineligible and not randomised, the IWRS should be contacted to terminate the participant in the system (screen failed). Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may be rescreened once (per screening part), upon the Study Physician's approval and agreement.  However, rescreening should be documented so that its effect on study results, if any, can be assessed.  These participants should have the reason for study withdrawal, including failed inclusion\/exclusion criteria, recorded in the eCRF.  Rescreened participants should be assigned the same participant number as for the initial screening. 6  STUDY INTERVENTION Study intervention is defined as any investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s), placebo, or medical device(s) intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study protocol.  Study intervention in this study refers to capivasertib or placebo, and abiraterone, administered from the date of randomisation. Abiraterone is indicated for use in combination with ADT, and it is also recommended that abiraterone is used with prednisone or prednisolone; for details see Section 6.5.1.  In this study, ADT, prednisone, and prednisolone are NIMPs\/background therapy, and these should be prescribed in accordance with local guidelines, where applicable. 6.1  Study Intervention(s) Administered 6.1.1  Investigational Products Details of the Investigational Products are provided in Table 4."

Where possible, all doses of capivasertib\/placebo should be taken at approximately the same time each day, 12 hours apart in a fasted state (water to drink only) from at least 2 hours prior to the dose to at least 1 hour post-dose.  Additional fasting restrictions apply on days where fasting glucose is to be tested (Section 8.2.4.1).  If vomiting occurs, a replacement dose should not be taken, and the participant should take their allotted dose at the next scheduled time. Should a participant miss a scheduled dose, the participant will be allowed to take the dose up to a maximum of 2 hours after the scheduled dose time, with a fasting state being maintained.  If greater than 2 hours after the scheduled dose time, the missed dose should not be taken, and the participant should take their allotted dose at the next scheduled time.  If a participant needs to take the dose earlier, the participant can take the dose up to 2 hours earlier than the scheduled dose time.  The participant should make every reasonable effort to take the capivasertib\/placebo tablet(s) on time. Any regular medication required by the participant can be taken at the same time as capivasertib\/placebo in a fasted state (as described above), provided that this does not contravene the dosing instructions in the prescribing information for that medication. Abiraterone should be taken under fasting conditions (only water to drink) from at least 2 hours prior to dosing to at least 1 hour post-dose.  The tablets should be swallowed whole with water and not crushed or chewed. 6.1.2  Medical Devices Documented PTEN deficiency of tumour tissue is required for selection of participants onto the study.  All participants must provide FFPE tumour tissue (block or slides) from primary or metastatic sites (excluding bone metastases or FNA samples) for IHC-based determination of PTEN deficiency.  Ventana Medical Systems (Tucson, USA) will provide the Investigational Use Only (IUO) assay for centralised PTEN IHC testing.  This assay is being developed for approval as a companion diagnostic for capivasertib. 6.2  Preparation\/Handling\/Storage\/Accountability of Interventions The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study intervention received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study intervention. Only participants randomised in the study may receive study intervention and only authorised site staff may supply or administer study intervention.  All study intervention must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labelled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorised site staff. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). Any study drug remaining at the end of the study must be destroyed or returned according to the sites local standard operating procedures following authorisation by the sponsor. 6.3  Measures to Minimise Bias: Randomisation and Blinding Eligible participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio (capivasertib + abiraterone: placebo + abiraterone) by a permuted block randomisation approach stratified on the following factors: Combination of volume of disease according to CHAARTED criteria and presence of visceral metastases (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease) Geographic location (North America, Western Europe, and Australia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and Asia). Capivasertib and placebo tablets will be identical and presented in the same packaging to ensure blinding of the capivasertib.  Capivasertib and placebo will be labelled using a unique kit identification (kit ID) number, which is linked to the randomisation scheme. All participants will be centrally assigned to randomised study treatment using an IWRS.  Before the study is initiated, the log-in information and directions for the IWRS will be provided to each study site. Abiraterone will be allocated to be dispensed to each participant using the IWRS system (if centrally sourced) or via the local pharmacy (if locally sourced) at each participant dispensing visit.  Routines for this will be described in the IWRS user manual that will be provided to each centre. Each patient will obtain a unique randomisation number via the IWRS. The actual treatment given to individual participants will be determined by a randomisation scheme that will be loaded into the IWRS database.  The randomisation scheme will be produced by a computer software program called AZRand (AZ Global Randomisation system) that incorporates a standard procedure for generating random numbers. A blocked randomisation will be generated, and all centres will use the same list in order to minimise any imbalance in the number of participants assigned to each treatment group. Eligibility will be established before treatment randomisation.  It is recommended that participants commence study treatment as soon as possible after randomisation and ideally on the same day of randomisation. If a participant withdraws from the study, then his enrolment\/randomisation code cannot be reused.  Withdrawn participants will not be replaced. The IWRS will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions.  In case of an emergency, in which the knowledge of the specific blinded study treatment will affect the immediate management of the participant's condition (eg, antidote available), the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participants' intervention assignment is warranted.  Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination.  If a participant's intervention assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind.  The investigator must document and report the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing to AstraZeneca staff the treatment that was given to the participant. AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an IMP and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities.  Randomisation codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual participant have been made and documented. 6.4  Study Intervention Compliance Data regarding capivasertib\/placebo dosing will be collected during the scheduled site visits and entered into the eCRF along with reasons for missed dose(s) if applicable. In addition, participants will be required to return all bottles of study medication at the start of the next cycle.  The number of tablets remaining will be counted by the research nurse\/ pharmacist\/investigator, documented in the eCRF and returned to pharmacy.  Site personnel are responsible for managing the IMP from receipt by the study site until the destruction or return of all unused IMP. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the participant has returned all unused IMP. 6.5  Concomitant Therapy Any medication or vaccine, including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and\/or herbal supplements, that the participant is receiving at the time of enrolment or receives during the study must be recorded along with: Reason for use Dates of administration including start and end dates Dosage information including dose and frequency This includes details relating to the ADT and prednisone\/prednisolone administered as standard background treatment with the abiraterone. Guidance regarding potential interactions of capivasertib with concomitant medications is provided in Appendix C. 6.5.1  Recommended Concomitant Therapy The following therapies are recommended during study participation, as applicable: Corticosteroids: In the treatment of patients with mHSPC, abiraterone is indicated for use with corticosteroid in the form of 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone daily in line with the locally approved abiraterone package insert.  An increased dose of the corticosteroid may be indicated during and after a stressful situation.  Participants will receive the treating investigator's choice of commercially available prednisone or prednisolone. Androgen deprivation therapy: Abiraterone is indicated for use in combination with ADT; therefore, participants must be receiving the treating investigator's choice of commercially available LHRH analogues or have received surgical castration. Anti-diarrhoeal therapy for symptomatic treatment of diarrhoea, as indicated in the toxicity management guideline (see Section 8.3.12.3). Antidiabetic therapy for management of hyperglycaemia (see Section 8.3.12.3). Concomitant medication may be given as medically indicated.  Details (including doses, frequency, route, and start and stop dates) of the concomitant medication given must be recorded in the participant's medical records and in the eCRF. 6.5.2  Restricted Concomitant Therapy The following concomitant therapies are restricted during study treatment: Other anticancer agents, other investigational agents and radiotherapy, although radiation for palliation at focal sites is permitted (as long as the radiation field covers less than 30% of the marrow and does not include whole pelvis or spine; disease progression in the bones has to be excluded by appropriate imaging investigations). Drugs or herbal supplements that are known to be potent inhibitors\/inducers of CYP3A4, as they may increase\/decrease the exposure and thus, affect the toxicity\/efficacy of capivasertib. Drugs known to be sensitive to inhibition of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and\/or CYP2D6 metabolism and\/or MATE1 or OCT2 transport, and which have a narrow therapeutic window; see Appendix C for details.  If co-administration is necessary, then additional monitoring for signs of toxicity related to increased exposure to the substrates is required. The concomitant administration of drugs known to prolong the QT interval is restricted unless considered essential due to participant management, in which case, participants should be closely monitored.  Information regarding drugs known to prolong the QT interval can be found at URL: https:\/\/crediblemeds.org. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers and CYP2D6 substrates with abiraterone; for more details on restrictions and cautions required when administering concomitant medications with abiraterone, please refer to abiraterone local prescribing information. Patients are not eligible to enter the study if they have received any of the medications specified in the exclusion criteria or are unable to observe the cautions and restrictions for restricted therapies (for details please compare Section 5.2 and Appendix C). 6.5.3  Other Concomitant Treatment Supportive care, and other medication, other than that described in Section 6.5.2, considered necessary for the participant's safety and well-being, may be given at the discretion of the investigator and recorded in the appropriate sections of the eCRF. 6.6  Dose Modification 6.6.1  Dose Modification for Capivasertib Dose reductions or holds are allowed as clinically indicated by the treating physician and in line with Table 5.  For each participant, a maximum of 2 dose reductions will be allowed for capivasertib\/placebo.  Dose re-escalations are not allowed for either capivasertib\/placebo. Dose reductions for capivasertib\/placebo should be carried out as described in Table 5.  The dose of capivasertib\/placebo can be reduced twice (initially, reduction to dose reduction level 1; subsequently, in case of occurrence of further \u2265 grade 3 toxicity, further reduction to dose reduction level 2).  For guidance on dose reductions for management of capivasertib related AEs, refer to Section 8.3.12."

In addition, the investigator may decide that dosing of study treatment should be temporarily interrupted, a subsequent treatment cycle delayed, or study treatment permanently discontinued as per the guidelines outlined in Section 7.1. Substantial acute toxicities should be managed as medically indicated and with temporary suspension of study drug, as appropriate. A maximum break of 4 consecutive weeks is allowed within each treatment cycle or between 2 consecutive cycles.  Following a treatment break the participant can resume treatment at the Day in the cycle that they stopped.  If the treatment break is longer than the maximum of 4 consecutive weeks, the investigator will need permission from the sponsor Study Physician to allow the participant to restart study treatment. 6.6.2  Dose Modification for Abiraterone In case dose reductions are necessary for abiraterone, the investigator should refer to abiraterone local prescribing information for further details.  These dose reductions should be documented in the eCRF. 6.7  Intervention after the End of the Study After the clinical study database closes, participants who continue to derive clinical benefit from study treatments in the opinion of the investigator may continue to receive study treatment until progression.  These treatments will continue to be provided by AstraZeneca until the availability of either a local commercial supplier and reimbursement programme or an early access programme; at which point a change in supply will be requested.  Treatment of participants beyond progression is not allowed. Please refer to Section 4.4 for End of Study definition. 7  DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION\/WITHDRAWAL 7.1  Discontinuation of Study Intervention Participants may be discontinued from study treatment (ie, capivasertib\/placebo or abiraterone) in the following situations.  Note that discontinuation from study treatment is NOT the same as a complete withdrawal from the study. Participants who discontinue either capivasertib\/placebo or abiraterone should continue to undergo assessments as outlined in the SoA (Table 2).  Participants who discontinue both capivasertib\/placebo and abiraterone should continue the efficacy assessments until disease progression and survival follow-up as outlined in the SoA (Table 2). Radiographic progressive disease is confirmed by the investigator (RECIST 1.1 or PCWG3 bone progression criteria). Clinical disease progression\/worsening of disease under investigation. Participants incorrectly initiated on IMP. Intercurrent illness that, in the judgment of the investigator, will affect assessments of clinical status to a significant degree or contraindicate further dosing. Unacceptable toxicity. Determination by the investigator that it is no longer safe for the participant or in the participant's best interest to continue therapy. Participant request. Severe non-compliance with CSP in the judgement of the investigator and\/or the sponsor.  All protocol deviations must be reported. Clinical need for concomitant or ancillary therapy (ie, non-protocol-specified anticancer therapy) that is not permitted in the study. General or specific changes in the participant's condition that are unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. Participants found to be deriving benefit from treatment and tolerating treatment may continue therapy, subject to agreement between the treating and sponsor physicians.  The participants will be followed according to protocol-defined procedures and assessments.  All protocol deviations will be reviewed, and important protocol deviations will be identified prior to the unblinding of the study. See the SoA (Table 2) for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. All reasons for discontinuation of study treatment must be documented in the eCRF (see Section 7.1.2). 7.1.1  Study Treatment Interruptions If study treatment will be interrupted for a period longer than allowed in the dose modification guidelines (Section 6.6), the investigator will need permission from the sponsor to allow the participant to restart study treatment. 7.1.2  Procedures for Discontinuation of Study Treatment The investigator should instruct the participant to contact the site before or at the time the participant decides to stop the study treatment.  A participant who decides to discontinue study treatment must be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs.  The date of last intake of study treatment should be documented in the eCRF.  All study treatment should be returned by the participant at their next on-site study visit or unscheduled visit.  Participants permanently discontinuing study treatment should be given locally available standard of care therapy, at the discretion of the investigator. Discontinuation of study treatment, for any reason, does not impact on the participant's participation in the study.  The participant should continue attending subsequent study visits and data collection should continue according to the study protocol.  If the participant does not agree to continue in-person study visits, a modified follow-up must be arranged to ensure the collection of endpoints and safety information.  This could be a telephone contact with the participant, a contact with a relative or treating physician, or information from medical records.  The approach taken should be recorded in the medical records.  A participant that agrees to modified follow-up is not considered to have withdrawn consent or to have withdrawn from the study. If either abiraterone or capivasertib\/placebo is discontinued prior to disease progression, participants may remain on the other drug at the investigator's discretion until disease progression or evidence of unacceptable toxicity.  Participants who discontinue one of the study treatments but remain on the other should continue to have assessments performed as outlined in the SoA (Table 2).  Once both capivasertib\/placebo and abiraterone treatment are permanently discontinued, procedures should be followed for the discontinuation and follow up visits.  Participants who have permanently discontinued from further receipt of capivasertib\/placebo and abiraterone will need to be discontinued from the IWRS. 7.2  Participant Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioural, compliance, or administrative reasons.  This is expected to be uncommon. A participant who considers withdrawing from the study must be informed by the investigator about modified follow-up options (eg, telephone contact, a contact with a relative or treating physician, or information from medical records). At the time of withdrawal from the study, if possible, an Early Study Intervention Discontinuation visit should be conducted, as shown in the SoA.  See SoA (Table 2) for data to be collected at the time of study withdrawal and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.  All study treatment should be returned by the participant. The participant will discontinue the study intervention and be withdrawn from the study at that time. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study, it should be confirmed if they still agree for existing samples to be used in line with the original consent.  If the participant requests withdrawal of consent for use of samples, destruction of any samples taken and not tested should be carried in line with what was stated in the informed consent and local regulation.  The investigator must document the decision on use of existing samples in the site study records and inform the Global Study Team. A participant who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs.  The investigator will follow-up participants as medically indicated.  The participant will return electronic PRO (ePRO) devices. AstraZeneca or its delegate will request investigators to make every effort to collect information on participants' survival status (dead or alive; date of death when applicable) at the end of the study, including participants that withdrew consent or are classified as \u2018lost to follow up'.  Survival status can be obtained by site personnel from publicly available resources where it is possible, in accordance with local regulations.  Knowledge of the survival status at study end in all participants is crucial for the integrity of the study. 7.3  Lost to Follow-up A participant will be considered potentially lost to follow-up if they repeatedly fail to return for scheduled visits and are unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and\/or should continue in the study. Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant's last known mailing address or local equivalent methods).  These contact attempts should be documented in the participant's medical record. Efforts to reach the participant should continue until the end of the study.  Should the participant be unreachable at the end of the study, the participant should be considered to be lost to follow-up with unknown vital status at the end of study. Site personnel, or an independent third party, will attempt to collect the vital status of the participant within legal and ethical boundaries for all participants randomised, including those who did not receive investigational product.  Public sources may be searched for vital status information.  If vital status is determined as deceased, this will be documented and the participant will not be considered lost to follow-up.  Sponsor personnel will not be involved in any attempts to collect vital status information. Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole are handled as described in Appendix B 9. 8  STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarised in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria.  The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the participant's routine clinical management (eg, blood count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilised for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA. The investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRFs.  A Web-based Data Capture system will be used for data collection and query handling. The investigator must ensure the accuracy and completeness for eCRFs, which includes legibility and timeliness of the data recorded and of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement.  The investigator will sign the completed eCRFs.  A copy of the completed eCRFs will be archived at the study site. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples. 8.1  Efficacy Assessments 8.1.1  Tumour Assessments Tumour assessments will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and a bone scan for whole body.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before randomisation, and ideally, should be performed as close as possible to randomisation.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) relative to the date of randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), regardless of discontinuation of study treatment (eg, discontinuation due to toxicity or clinical progression) or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy. The assessments by different imaging modalities (eg, CT and bone scintigraphy) can be done on different days but should all be performed within the assessment schedule.  It is important to follow the imaging assessment schedule as closely as possible; however, tumour assessment can be performed at any time when disease progression is clinically suspected.  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged.  If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at the participant's scheduled visits. Participants who discontinue study treatment prior to progression should continue to be scanned until progression.  The same imaging modality and the same assessment (eg, the same contrast protocol for CT scans) should be performed at baseline and at all follow-up time points. Radiological examinations performed during the study should be retained at site as source data. 8.1.2  Evaluation of Disease Progression 8.1.2.1  Radiographic PFS Radiographic PFS is defined as the time from randomisation to: 1) radiographic progression, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), or 2) death due to any cause regardless of whether the participant withdraws from randomised treatment or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression. Radiographic PFS will be measured by investigator assessment, and a sensitivity analysis of PFS assessed by BICR will also be conducted (see Section 8.1.2.4). The definitions of measurable, non-measurable, target and non-target lesions for assessment of soft tissue using RECIST 1.1 criteria, methods of assessment, and the objective tumour response criteria are provided in Appendix E 2.  The PCWG3 guidelines are provided in Appendix E 3. Participants who have not progressed, as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) or PCWG3 criteria (bone), or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 assessment.  However, if the participant progresses or dies immediately after 2 or more consecutive missed visits, the participant will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 bone assessment prior to the 2 missed visits. 8.1.2.2  Evaluation of Soft Tissue Lesions The criteria for objective tumour response on soft tissue lesions will be based on RECIST 1.1: CR (complete response), PR (partial response), SD (stable disease), PD (progressive disease), NE (not evaluable), and NED (no evidence of disease). For participants with measurable lesion at baseline, target lesion progression will be calculated in reference to the smallest tumour burden on study (ie, the smallest sum of diameters previously recorded on study).  In the absence of progression, target lesion response will be calculated using as reference the baseline tumour measurements obtained before starting treatment.  For these participants, the objective tumour response assessment options are CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE. For participants with non-measurable soft tissue lesions only at baseline, the objective tumour response assessment options are CR, PD, Non CR\/Non PD, and NE. For participants with bone lesions only and no soft tissue disease at baseline, the objective tumour response assessment options will be NED, PD (if a new soft tissue lesion appears), or NE (if the scan is not performed). If the investigator is in doubt as to whether disease progression has occurred, particularly with regard to non-target lesions or the appearance of a new lesion, it is advisable to continue treatment and reassess the tumour burden at the next scheduled assessment or sooner if clinically indicated.  If repeat scans confirm progression, then the date of the initial scan should be declared as the date of progression.  New bone lesions should not be counted in the RECIST assessment. To achieve \u2018unequivocal progression' on the basis of non-target lesions, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest \u2018increase' in the size of 1 or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. 8.1.2.3  Evaluation of Bone Lesions Progression on a bone scan is identified using PCWG3 criteria, by having 2 or more new metastatic bone lesions. For participants without progression at the first visit after baseline, the scan from this first visit after baseline now serves as new reference for all subsequent scans, ie, assuming all visits are acquired according to schedule, all bone scans after Week 16 are compared to the Week 16 scan. The requirements for determination of radiographic progression by either bone scan (bone progression) or CT\/MRI (soft tissue progression) are summarised in Table 6."

Images, including unscheduled visit scans, will be collected on an ongoing basis and sent to an AstraZeneca-appointed imaging Contract Research Organisation (iCRO) for QC, storage, and for BICR.  Digital copies of all original scans should be stored at the investigator site as source documents.  Electronic image transfer from the sites to the iCRO is strongly encouraged.  A BICR of images will be performed at the discretion of AstraZeneca.  Results of these independent reviews will not be communicated to investigators, and results of investigator tumour assessments will not be shared with the central reviewers.  The management of participants will be based solely upon the results of the RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and PCWG3 (bone) assessment conducted by the investigator. All treatment decisions will be based on site assessment of scans.  After the primary rPFS analysis, central review of scans will no longer be required, and investigators will be advised when to stop sending copies of the scans to the CRO conducting the central review. 8.1.2.5  PFS2 PFS2 is defined as the time from randomisation until progression on next-line treatment (ie, the line of treatment following the first progression in the study), as clinical progression, PSA progression, or radiographic progression determined by RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone) as assessed by the investigator, or death due to any cause.  Censoring details will be defined in the SAP. A participant will enter the PFS2 follow-up period once that participant has discontinued study treatment due to progressive disease by RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue lesions and\/or PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions. The participant's status at first progression will be used as the reference for assessment of PFS2. RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 assessments will not be collected for assessment of PFS2. The date of PFS2 assessment and the investigator's opinion of progression status (progressed or non-progressed) at each assessment will be recorded in the eCRF.  Determination of progressive disease for PFS2 will be by institutional call. 8.1.3  Overall Survival Overall survival is the length of time from randomisation until the date of death due to any cause.  In the survival follow-up period, all subsequent cancer therapies and vital status will be documented at least every 12 weeks until death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first. Any participant not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the participant was known to be alive. Survival information may be obtained via telephone contact with the participant, participant's family, by contact with the participant's current physician, or local death registries as described in Section 7.3. Survival calls will be made in the week following the date of DCO for each of the rPFS or OS analyses.  If participants are confirmed to be alive or if the death date is after the DCO date, these participants will be censored at the date of DCO. 8.1.4  Time to PSA Progression Time to PSA progression is defined as the time from randomisation to PSA progression, as determined by PCWG3 criteria: PSA progression is the date that an increase of 25% or more and absolute increase of 2 ng\/mL or more from the nadir are documented, which is confirmed by a second value obtained 3 or more weeks later.  Censoring details for this endpoint will be defined in the SAP. Blood samples for PSA measurements will be collected and evaluated by the local testing laboratory at timelines as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  These assessments should continue until disease progression, regardless of discontinuation of study treatment. 8.1.5  Time to First Subsequent Therapy Time to First Subsequent Therapy (TFST) is defined as time from randomisation to the earlier of start date of the first subsequent anticancer therapy after discontinuation of randomised treatment, or death due to any cause. All anticancer treatments (including, but not limited to, chemotherapy and targeted agents), and the investigator's opinion of response to these treatments plus the date of progression, following discontinuation of study treatment, must be recorded.  Subsequent systemic anticancer therapies (excluding radiotherapy) will be reviewed prior to data unblinding to assess which represent clinically important treatments intended to control prostate cancer.  Any participant not known to have died at the time of the analysis and not known to have had a further anticancer therapy will be censored at the last known time to have not received subsequent therapy, ie, the last follow-up visit where this was confirmed. 8.1.6  SSE-FS Symptomatic skeletal event-free survival (SSE-FS) is defined as the time from randomisation until any of the following (or death due to any cause): Use of radiation therapy to prevent or relieve skeletal symptoms. Occurrence of new symptomatic pathological bone fractures (vertebral or non-vertebral).  Radiologic documentation is required.  A pathological fracture, as determined by investigator, is defined as associated with low or no trauma and deemed to have occurred at a site of bone metastasis. Occurrence of spinal cord compression.  Radiologic documentation is required. Orthopaedic surgical intervention for bone metastasis. Participants who have not experienced any of the above conditions will be censored at the time of the last SSE assessment. Assessments for symptomatic skeletal events will be performed at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 1.3), and should continue beyond disease progression, regardless of discontinuation of study treatment. 8.1.7  Time to Castration Resistance Time to castration resistance (TTCR) is defined as the time from randomisation to the first castration-resistant event (radiographic disease progression, PSA progression, or SSE), whichever occurs first, at castrate levels of testosterone (below 50 ng\/dL).  Censoring details will be defined in the SAP. The timepoints of assessments for radiographic progression and SSEs, and collection of samples for determination of PSA and serum testosterone levels are indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3). 8.1.8  Patient-reported Outcomes A clinical outcome assessment (COA) is an assessment of a clinical outcome reported by a clinician, a patient, or a non-clinician observer, or through a performance-based assessment (FDA-NIH BEST Resource).  A COA may be used in clinical studies to provide either direct or indirect evidence of treatment benefit.  It is important to examine the impact of therapy on disease-related symptoms, physical function, and other HRQoL of the patient to aid understanding of how clinical benefit relates to patient well-being and for consideration in making risk-benefit evaluations.  PRO is one type of clinical outcome assessment and is a general term referring to all outcomes and symptoms that are directly reported by the patient.  Moreover, PROs assist in the documentation of symptoms and specifically what symptoms and impacts are most important to patients and how these relate to clinical outcomes.  PROs have become important in evaluating effectiveness of study treatments in clinical studies and will aid in understanding of the benefit\/risk evaluation (Kluetz et al 2018).  The following PROs will be administered in this study: BPI-SF, BFI, FACT-P, PGIS, EQ-5D-5L, and selected questions from the PRO-CTCAE items library.  Samples of the PRO questionnaires are provided in Appendix F.  PROs will be administered according to the SoA (Section 1.3).  PROs will be provided in the native language(s) of the country in which they will be administered, except for PRO-CTCAE, which will only be administered in the languages where a linguistically validated version is available. 8.1.8.1  BPI-SF The BPI-SF (Appendix F 1) is a validated, 15-item domain-specific instrument designed to assess the severity of pain and the impact\/interference of pain on daily functions (Cleeland and Ryan 1994).  The BPI-SF will be scored according to the user guide (Cleeland 2009).  All BPI-SF pain items including \u2018worst pain' is scored on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS) with 0 = No Pain and 10 = Worst Pain Imaginable.  This instrument consists of 2 domains: pain severity and pain interference.  The pain severity domain consists of 4 items (Item 3, Item 4, Item 5, and Item 6) which assess pain at its \u2018worst,' \u2018least,' \u2018average,' and \u2018now' (current pain) respectively on the 11-point NRS.  These 4 items may be averaged as a composite pain severity score or they may be interpreted individually (Dworkin et al 2005, Dworkin et al 2008, FDA 2009, Turk et al 2006).  In this study, the \u2018worst pain' (Item 3) will be used as a single item in assessing pain progression.  A composite pain severity score from all the 4 items will also be evaluated.  A 2- or more point change in the \u2018worst pain' item is considered clinically meaningful. The pain interference domain score is a mean of 7 items: general activity (Item 9A), mood (Item 9B), walking ability (Item 9C), normal work (Item 9D), relations with other people (Item 9E), sleep (Item 9F), and enjoyment of life (Item 9G), each scored on an 11-point NRS from 0 (Does not interfere) to 10 (Completely interferes).  Based on the BPI-SF scoring manual, the following items are not used in scoring pain severity or pain interference domains: Items 1, 2, 7, and 8.  Item 7 (a free text field) describing pain medication use is captured separately in more detail using the analgesic log. The BPI-SF analgesic log (captured on ePRO device) will be completed by the participant as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Further details on the analgesic log and scoring are provided in Sections 8.1.8.8 and 8.1.8.9, respectively. Time to pain progression is a key secondary endpoint of this study (see Section 8.1.8.2).  In addition, change from baseline in pain severity and pain interference domain scores may be derived. 8.1.8.2  Time to Pain Progression The key secondary endpoint of TTPP is defined as the time from randomisation to the time point at which clinically meaningful pain progression is observed, based on a 2-point increase from baseline in the BPI-SF Item 3 \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' score and\/or initiation of\/increase in opiate analgesic use.  A minimum of 4 days of data is required.  The criteria for pain progression depend on whether a participant is asymptomatic or symptomatic at baseline: Asymptomatic participants at baseline (average BPI-SF Item 3 score of 0 and not taking opioids) Increase of 2 or more points in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' (BPI-SF Item 3) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks) OR Initiation of opioid use for pain Symptomatic participants at baseline (average BPI-SF Item 3 score > 0 and\/or currently taking opioids) Increase of 2 or more points in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' (BPI-SF Item 3) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks) and an average worst pain score \u2265 4, and no decrease in average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or more points decrease in AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher OR Increase in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or more points increase (or at least 2 points increase if the starting value is 0) in the AQA score from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks). Participants satisfying one or more of the criteria above will be considered to have pain progression.  Participants who do not satisfy any of the criteria above will be censored at the time of the last known assessment that showed an absence of pain progression. Censoring A number of situations will lead to a participant's time to pain progression being censored; these are as follows: If a participant meets the criteria for pain progression after 2 or more missed visits (visits which showed < 4 days of BPI-SF worst pain [Item 3] assessments and the average AQA score does not meet the progression criteria), then the participant will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used). Participants who have not met the criteria for pain progression at the time of analysis: The censoring date will be the date of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used). Participants with no evaluable baseline or post-baseline data will be censored at Day 1. For participants who receive subsequent anticancer therapy: The censoring date will be the date of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment prior to the start date of subsequent anticancer therapy (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used) Participants with no evaluable baseline or post-baseline data will be censored at Day 1. 8.1.8.3  Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) The BFI (Appendix F 2) is a self-administered instrument developed to assess the severity of fatigue and the impact of fatigue on functioning (Mendoza et al 1999).  It includes 9 items which measure fatigue severity (3 items) and fatigue interference (6 items).  The first 3 items (Item 1, Item 2, and Item 3) ask participants about their: level of fatigue right now, usual level of fatigue within the past 24 hours, and fatigue at its worst level within the past 24 hours on an 11-point NRS of 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine).  The 6 fatigue interference items (Item 4A, Item 4B, Item 4C, Item 4D, Item 4E, and Item 4F, respectively) evaluate participants on the extent to which fatigue interfered with their daily activities (ie, general activity, mood, walking, work, relationships, and enjoyment of life) on an 11-point NRS of 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).  While not developed specifically for prostate cancer or mHSPC, its reliability and clinical and concurrent validity have been demonstrated in cancer more generally (Mendoza et al 1999, Whitehead 2009).  It has also been used to measure fatigue in one mHSPC study (LATITUDE, Fizazi et al 2019) and one mCRPC study (COU-AA-301, Sternberg et al 2013), respectively.  The items\/scales used to measure fatigue in LATITUDE are not specified.  In COU-AA-301, fatigue was measured via \u2018fatigue intensity', defined as the score of the worst fatigue item (Item 3), and \u2018fatigue interference', defined as the average score of all the interference items (Items 4A - 4F).  A clinically important difference in \u2018fatigue intensity' was defined in this study as a change in \u2265 2 points from baseline, while a change in \u2265 1.25 points from baseline for \u2018fatigue interference' was considered clinically meaningful (Sternberg et al 2013).  These clinically important thresholds will be used in the current study. In this study, the \u2018worst fatigue' (Item 3) will be used as a single item in assessing deterioration in \u2018fatigue intensity'.  Also, a composite or mean score of 3 items (Items 1-3) will be evaluated as \u2018fatigue severity'.  Finally, a \u2018fatigue interference' domain score will be based on a mean of the 6 interference items (Items 4A-4F). The following may be derived as secondary endpoints: Time to deterioration in fatigue intensity (defined as a change \u2265 2 points from baseline in worst fatigue item [Item 3] score). Time to deterioration in fatigue interference (defined as a change \u2265 1.25 points from baseline in fatigue interference domain score). Change from baseline in fatigue severity and fatigue interference domain scores. 8.1.8.4  FACT-P The FACT-P (Appendix F 3) is a disease-specific 39-item questionnaire included for the purpose of assessing HRQoL and prostate cancer-specific symptoms.  It is a well-established measure of HRQoL\/health status commonly used in prostate cancer studies.  The FACT-P was developed specifically for patients with advanced prostate cancer and has been found to be reliable and valid in this population (Esper et al 1997).  The FACT-P consists of 5 subscales: Physical Well-Being (PWB; 7 items), Functional Well-Being (FWB; 7 items), Emotional Well-Being (EWB; 6 items), Social Well-Being (SWB; 7 items), and Additional Concerns or Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS) specific to prostate cancer (12 items).  All FACT-P questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4 (0 being not at all and 4 being very much).  Negatively stated items are reversed by subtracting the response from 4.  For all subscales, symptoms index, and individual item scores, the higher the score, the better the HRQoL\/symptom.  In addition to the Total and Subscale scores, the FACT-P also supports the calculation of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) total score (sum of PWB, SWB, EWB, and FWB scores), a Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score (the sum of the PWB, FWB, and PCS scores), and the FACT Advanced Prostate Symptom Index-6 (FAPSI-6), a symptom score made up of 6 items from within the FACT-P (3 pain items, 1 fatigue item, 1 weight loss item, and 1 condition getting worse item). The following may be derived as other secondary endpoints: Time to deterioration in FACT-P scores (FACT-P total score, FACT-G total score, TOI, functional well-being, physical well-being, prostate cancer subscale, and FAPSI-6, respectively). Change from baseline in FACT-P scores (FACT-P total score, FACT-G total score, TOI, functional well-being, physical well-being, prostate cancer subscale, and FAPSI-6, respectively). 8.1.8.5  PRO-CTCAE The PRO-CTCAE (Appendix F 5) will only be administered where a linguistically validated version exists for a country. PRO-CTCAE was developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and is included to address tolerability from the patients' perspective.  PRO-CTCAE is an item library of symptoms experienced by patients while undergoing treatment of their cancer.  It was developed in recognition that collecting treatment-related symptom data directly from patients using PRO tools can improve the accuracy and efficiency of symptomatic AE data collection.  This was based on findings from multiple studies demonstrating that physicians and nurses underestimate symptom onset, frequency, and severity in comparison with patient ratings (Basch et al 2009, Litwin et al 1998, Sprangers and Aaronson 1992).  To date, 78 symptoms of the CTCAE have been identified to be amenable to patient reporting.  These symptoms have been converted to patient terms (eg, CTCAE term \u2018myalgia' converted to \u2018aching muscles').  The items included in the PRO-CTCAE have undergone extensive qualitative review among experts and patients.  Using cognitive testing methods, these items and the additional questions for some of the symptoms have been extensively evaluated by cancer patients, so that symptoms of interest are clear, comprehendible, and measurable.  Not all items are administered in any one clinical study.  The intention is to only ask participants to complete those items considered relevant for the study, site of cancer, and cancer treatment.  Participants on all study arms will complete the same selection of symptom items for the PRO-CTCAE.  Several decision rules were applied to the selection to achieve an unbiased selection and reasonable patient completion time.  Safety data for capivasertib, abiraterone acetate, and hormonal treatments (administered in both arms of the study) informed the symptom selection.  Safety and AE data for capivasertib was accessed via the most recent IB, while the US Package Inserts were used to assess the abiraterone and ADT.  Symptomatic AEs from the PRO-CTCAE items library that are considered relevant based on the reported safety and AEs for capivasertib, abiraterone, and hormonal treatments were selected for this study (see Appendix F 5). The Free Text item in the PRO-CTCAE instrument is not included in this study, as the utility of this information and the analysis method have not been established.  The full list of items is available in Appendix F 5. 8.1.8.6  PGIS The impact of treatment on the overall severity of cancer symptoms over the past week will be assessed using the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) single-item questionnaire (Appendix F 4).  PGIS is useful for determining the responder threshold of other PRO measures. 8.1.8.7  EQ-5D-5L The EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal (EuroQol Group 1990).  Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in population health surveys.  The questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions as follows: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain\/discomfort, and anxiety\/depression.  Each dimension has 5 response options (\u2018no problems', \u2018slight problems', \u2018moderate problems', \u2018severe problems', and \u2018extreme problems') that reflect increasing levels of difficulty (EuroQol Group 2013). Previous versions of EQ-5D had only 3 levels of difficulty, EQ-5D-3L.  Since 2009, the EuroQol Group developed a more sensitive version of the EQ-5D (the EQ-5D-5L) that expands the range of responses to each dimension from 3 to 5 levels of increasing severity (Herdman et al 2011).  Preliminary studies indicate that the 5L version improves upon the properties of the 3L measure in terms of reduced ceiling effect, increased reliability, and an improved ability to differentiate between different levels of health (Janssen et al 2008a, Janssen et al 2008b, Pickard et al 2007).  A sample of the EQ-5D-5L is provided in Appendix F 6. The participant will be asked to indicate their current health state by selecting the most appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensions.  The questionnaire also includes a visual analog scale, where the participant will be asked to rate current health status on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst imaginable health state. 8.1.8.8  Analgesic Log The analgesic log will be implemented using the ERT Medication Module\u2122, a component of the ERT eCOA System that serves for accurately tracking subject consumption of concomitant and\/or rescue medications.  The Medication Module allows medication data capture via the ERT eCOA Universal App, followed by the review and management of that data by sites and sponsors.  The Medication Module provides a consistent, easier-to-use and more efficient tool compared with paper-based reporting.  Using the module, participants will record all analgesic medication dosages and dosage times to track pain medications use.  The Medication Module includes the following components: Global Master Medication List: This list will be developed collaboratively by ERT and AstraZeneca and will contain all approved analgesic drug names including generic names and formulations.  The list will be updated over the course of the study via an approval workflow process, when necessary. eCOA Universal App Medication Diary: The medication diary will allow participants to log analgesic medication intake during scheduled assessments.  Study sites will check and update the medication diary for participants as needed throughout the study. Medication Report: This may be used to remotely update the tailored list of medications available on a participant's eCOA Universal App. The analgesic log is study specific (not generic) and screenshots will be available and submitted along with the CSP to IRB\/IECs. Although information on all analgesics used by participants in pain control will be collected using the analgesic log, only changes in opiate are considered in pain progression evaluation in line with FDA recommendation.  Opiates consumed by participants will be converted into oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) as defined in Chung et al 2014.  The analgesic quantification algorithm (AQA) developed by Chung et al 2014 will be used to quantify and score analgesic use in the study.  The AQA is an 8-point scale that assigns a score as follows: 0 = No analgesic 1 = Non-opioid analgesics 2 = Weak opioids (eg, codeine, tramadol) 3 = Strong opioids \u2264 75 mg OME per day 4 = Strong opioids > 75 to 150 mg OME per day 5 = Strong opioids > 150 to 300 mg OME per day 6 = Strong opioids > 300 to 600 mg OME per day 7 = Strong opioids > 600 mg OME per day 8.1.8.9  Analgesic Use Scoring Opiate analgesic use (AQA score) will be assessed at timelines specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  The average daily OME will require at least 4 days of data and will be used to assign the AQA score.  An increase of 1 point or more in the AQA score from a starting value of 1 or higher OR \u2265 2 points in AQA score from a starting value of 0 is considered a clinically meaningful increase in opiate use.  Similarly, a decrease of 1 point or more in the AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher is considered a clinically meaningful decrease in opiate use. 8.1.8.10  Administration of PRO Questionnaires The PRO instruments will be self-administered at home by the participants using handheld devices at the time points indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Participants may complete the ePROs at study sites if the assessment time point coincides with a scheduled site visit; otherwise, participants may complete the ePROs at home.  The analgesic use log using the ERT Medication Module\u2122 will also be administered electronically alongside the ePROs.  If there is a technical issue with the device, the site will have access to a web-based back up. Each site must allocate the responsibility for the administration of the ePRO instruments to a specific individual (eg, a research nurse or study coordinator) and, if possible, assign a backup person to cover if that individual is absent. Approximately 15 to 30 minutes is required for participants to complete the questionnaires. The below instructions should be followed when collecting PRO data via an electronic device: PRO questionnaires completed at site visits must be completed prior to treatment administration and ideally before any discussions of health status to avoid biasing the participant's responses to the questions.  As feasible, site staff should also ensure PRO questionnaires are completed prior to other study procedures, such as collection of laboratory samples, to further minimise bias. When each instrument is due to be completed, the following order will be observed: BPI-SF, BFI, Analgesic Log, FACT-P, PGIS, EQ-5D-5L, and then PRO-CTCAE. PRO questionnaires should be completed by the participant in a quiet and private location. The participant should be given sufficient time to complete the questionnaires at their own speed. The research nurse or appointed site staff must explain to participants the value and relevance of ePRO participation, so they are motivated to comply with questionnaire completion.  Inform the participant that these questions are being asked to find out, directly from them, how they feel. The research nurse or appointed site staff should stress that the information is not routinely shared with study staff. Therefore, if the participant has any medical problems, they should discuss them with the doctor or research nurse separately from the ePRO assessment. The research nurse or appointed site staff must train the participant on how to use the PRO device, using the materials and training provided by the ePRO vendor. The research nurse or appointed site staff must provide guidance on whom to call if there are problems with the device if the participant is completing the ePRO at home. All questionnaires must be completed using the ePRO device; paper questionnaires are not allowed in this study. The research nurse or appointed site staff must remind participants there are no right or wrong answers and avoid introducing bias by not clarifying items for the participant. The participant should not receive help from relatives, friends, or clinic staff to respond to the ePRO questionnaires.  The responses are the participant's alone. On completion of the questionnaire at the site, the device should be handed back to the designated responsible person, who should check that all questionnaires were completed. If a participant uses visual aids (eg, spectacles or contact lenses) for reading and does not have them when he or she attends the clinic, the participant will be exempted from completing the ePROs at that clinic visit, though they can complete them at home if within the allowable window. Site staff must not read or complete the ePRO questionnaires on behalf of the participant.  If the participant is unable to read the questionnaire (eg, is blind or illiterate), that participant is exempted from completing PRO questionnaires but may still participate in the study.  If the participant cannot complete the ePRO questionnaires due to other than being blind or illiterate, the AstraZeneca study team must be contacted to determine if they can be exempted.  This includes requirements for screening questionnaires.  Participants exempted in this regard should be flagged appropriately by the site staff in the source documents and in the Review of PRO\/Questionnaire\/Diary (REVPRDI) eCRF. Site staff must administer questionnaires available in the language that the participant speaks and understands.  Questions should not be read in an available language and translated into another language for the participant. It is vital that the ePRO reporting is conducted at the Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1 visit, as specified in the SoA.  The participant should bring the device to every site visit so the site can confirm the device is functioning properly.  It is especially critical the participant bring the device to the Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1 visit so not to miss the assessments that have baseline at this visit.  The ePRO device must be charged and fully functional at the beginning of the baseline visit to ensure that the PROs can be completed at the start of the visit. Finally, the research nurse or appointed site staff will review the completion status of questionnaires during site visits and document the reason(s) why a participant could not complete assessments either in the REVPRDI eCRF or the device depending on the set-up for the study. Reminders should be sent to the participant at home as needed to ensure compliance with the assessment schedules.  The research nurse or appointed site staff must monitor compliance, since minimising missing data is a key aspect of study success.  It is important that the PRO device is charged and fully functional.  Compliance must be checked at each study visit and should be checked more frequently to identify problems early.  If compliance drops below 88%, they will be flagged in the routine compliance report generated by the ePRO system, and a check-in call from the study site to ask the participant if he or she has any difficulties is highly recommended.  A solution to enhance\/resolve compliance should be discussed with the participant.  Discussions and compliance review should be reflected in source documents. 8.1.8.11  Unify Mobile Software Application The electronic device containing the PRO instruments will also contain a Unify mobile software application.  The Unify mobile software application, and associated website system, will provide digital support to patients from screening through to, and including, follow-up.  The system will provide patients and site study staff with information and tools relevant to the conduct of the study in accordance with this CSP.  This will comprise treatment medication reminders, clinical visit reminders, and educational content relating to the disease and medication. 8.2  Safety Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Section 1.3). 8.2.1  Physical Examinations The physical examination will be performed at timelines as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3) and will include an assessment of the following: general appearance, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdomen skin, head and neck (including ears, eyes, nose and throat), lymph nodes, thyroid, musculoskeletal (including spine and extremities) and neurological systems. Weight and height will be assessed at timelines as specified in the SoA. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses, new or worsening abnormalities may qualify as AEs. 8.2.2  Vital Signs Vital signs (including blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature) will be assessed at timelines as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed with a completely automated device.  Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones). Vital signs will be measured in a supine position after 10 minutes rest and will include temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse.  Three readings of blood pressure and pulse will be taken and should be reported in the participant's notes.  The first reading should be rejected.  The second and third readings should be averaged to give the measurement to be recorded in the eCRF. 8.2.3  Electrocardiograms Triplicate 12-lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (Section 1.3). All ECGs to be conducted as triplicate measurements, within approximately 5 minutes of starting (the 3 ECGs separated by approximately 2 minutes).  Assessments should be performed as close as possible to, but within 30 minutes of the nominal time point. The timing and number of ECGs may be altered depending on the emerging PK and safety profile.  Additional ECGs may be taken at the discretion of the investigator. Twelve-lead ECGs will be obtained after the participant has been resting semi-supine for at least 10 minutes prior to the times indicated.  All ECGs should be recorded with the participant in the same physical position.  A standardised ECG machine should be used and the participant should be examined using the same machine throughout the study if possible. After paper ECGs have been recorded, the investigator or designated physician will review each of the ECGs and may refer to a local cardiologist if appropriate.  A paper copy should be filed in the participant's medical records. If an abnormal ECG finding at screening or baseline is considered clinically significant by the investigator, it should be reported as a concurrent condition.  For all ECGs, details of intervals PR, R-R, QRS, QT, and QTcF and an overall evaluation will be recorded (normal; abnormal, non-clinically significant or abnormal, clinically significant). 8.2.4  Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis will be taken at the visits indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3). Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator.  The date, time of collection and results (values, units, and reference ranges) will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. The clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis will be performed at a local laboratory at or near to the investigator site.  Sample tubes and sample sizes may vary depending on laboratory method used and routine practice at the site. Laboratory values that meet the criteria for CTCAE grade 3 or have changed significantly from baseline and are considered to be of clinical concern will be repeated\/confirmed within 7 days and followed up as appropriate. The investigator should assess the available results with regard to clinically relevant abnormalities.  The laboratory results should be signed and dated and retained at centre as source data for laboratory variables.  For information on how AEs based on laboratory tests should be recorded and reported, see Section 8.3.6. Table 7 lists the clinical safety laboratory variables to be measured. "

On blood glucose assessment days (incorporating clinical chemistry and glucose) it is requested that participants refrain from caloric intake for \u2265 4 hours prior to the morning dose of study treatment. Glucose (fasting) is to be measured at screening, pre-dose; at 1 hour and 4 hours post-dose in Cycle 1, Day 1; pre-dose on Cycle 1, Day 15; pre-dose in Cycle 2, Day 1; and at discontinuation of study treatment. Further glucose monitoring may be performed at the investigator's discretion in Cycles 1 and 2 based on the participant's characteristics (ie, diabetes or high risk of hyperglycaemia), and in Cycle 3 onwards based on results during Cycles 1 and 2. HbA1c is to be measured at screening, every 16 weeks from Cycle 1, Day 1, and at discontinuation of study treatment. Note: in addition to the fasted glucose assessments identified in the SoA (Section 1.3), random glucose measurements are to be performed (and recorded) as part of the standard clinical chemistry assessments throughout the study. 8.2.4.2  Serum Creatinine After Cycle 2 onwards, participants taking capivasertib\/placebo and metformin in combination should have creatinine assessments conducted as part of the routine clinical chemistry with additional monitoring of creatinine at the discretion of the investigator. 8.2.5  MUGA Scan\/Echocardiogram Assessments will be performed at screening and thereafter as clinically indicated.  Bidimensional echocardiography (Echo) is the preferred modality because of the global technetium [Tc-99m] shortage (but MUGA can be used alternatively). The modality of the cardiac function assessments must be consistent within participant, ie, if echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment and a follow-up assessment if clinically indicated, then echocardiogram should also be used for subsequent scans if required.  The participant should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible. 8.3  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The Principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix H. AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorised representative). The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE.  For information on how to follow up AEs see Section 8.3.2. 8.3.1  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information Adverse events, including SAEs, will be collected from time of signature of the ICF, throughout the treatment period and including the 30-day follow-up period after discontinuation of study drug.  * *In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs\/SAEs must be reported. If the investigator becomes aware of a SAE with a suspected causal relationship to the IMP that occurs after the end of the clinical study in a participant treated by him or her, the investigator shall, without undue delay, report the SAE to the sponsor. 8.3.2  Follow-up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE\/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits\/contacts.  All SAEs\/non-serious AEs (as defined in Appendix H), will be followed until resolution, stabilisation, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up. A post-study assessment will be performed preferably within 7 days of the time that the IMP is permanently discontinued. Safety follow-up should be carried out with the participant 30 days (+ 7 days) after the discontinuation of study treatment to follow-up any SAEs\/AEs and concomitant medications (including any subsequent cancer therapy). Any AE\/SAE\/abnormal laboratory findings that are ongoing at the time of study treatment discontinuation or any new treatment related events within 30 days of study treatment, must be followed up to resolution or until the event becomes stable (or returns to baseline) or is unlikely to resolve further in the opinion of the investigator. Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant's last AE assessment or other assessment\/visit as appropriate in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF.  AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any participant with ongoing AE(s)\/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 8.3.3  Adverse Event Variables The following variables will be collected for each AE: AE (verbatim) The date when the AE started and stopped CTCAE grade and changes in CTCAE grade Whether the AE is serious or not Investigator causality rating against the IMP(s) (yes or no) Action taken with regard to IMP(s) AE caused participant's withdrawal from study (yes or no) Outcome. In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: Date AE met criteria for serious AE Date investigator became aware of SAE AE is serious due to Date of hospitalisation Date of discharge Probable cause of death Date of death Autopsy performed Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) Causality assessment to other medication 8.3.4  Causality Collection The investigator should assess the causal relationship between the IMP and each AE, and answer \u2018yes' or \u2018no' to the question \u2018Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?' For SAEs, causal relationship should also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as \u2018yes'. A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix H. 8.3.5  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the participant or reported in response to the open question from the study site staff (eg, \u2018Have you had any health problems since the previous visit\/you were last asked?'), or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF.  When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 8.3.6  Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests The results from the CSP-mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG abnormalities should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria, are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product or are considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the investigator (which may include but not limited to consideration as to whether treatment or non-planned visits were required or other action was taken with the study treatment, eg, dose adjustment or drug interruption). If deterioration in a laboratory value\/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result\/vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE\/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally related to the disease under study (see Section 8.3.8). 8.3.7  Hy's Law Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT \u2265 3xULN together with total bilirubin \u2265 2xULN may need to be reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix G for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy's Law. 8.3.8  Disease Progression Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a participant's condition attributable to the disease for which the investigational product is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and\/or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The development of new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events that are unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an AE during the study. 8.3.9  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational product, or to the study procedure(s)*.  All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. *In Screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting). If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately.  investigators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the EDC system, an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the EDC system is not available, then the investigator or other study site staff reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the investigator\/study site staff how to proceed. For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix H. The reference document for definition of expectedness\/listedness for capivasertib is the current IB; for abiraterone, the local prescribing information is the reference document for definition of expectedness\/listedness. 8.3.10  Pregnancy Paternal Exposure Participants should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 16 weeks following the last dose of capivasertib\/placebo. Pregnancy of the participants' partners is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until 16 weeks after the last dose should, if possible, be followed up and documented. 8.3.11  Medication Error If a medication error occurs in the course of the study, then the investigator or other site personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is completed within 1 (Initial Fatal\/Life-Threatening or follow up Fatal\/Life-Threatening) or 5 (other serious initial and follow up) calendar days if there is an SAE associated with the medication error (see Section 8.3.9) and within 30 days for all other medication errors. The definition of a Medication Error can be found in Appendix H 4. 8.3.12  Management of Capivasertib-related Toxicities 8.3.12.1  Capivasertib\/Placebo Dose Modification and Guidance Please refer to Section 6.6 for guidance on dose modifications. 8.3.12.2  Dose Modifications due to General Capivasertib-related Toxicities Treatment with capivasertib\/placebo should be temporarily interrupted for any intolerable AE regardless of grade or for any AEs grade \u2265 3 that occurs despite optimal supportive care, are not attributable to the disease under investigation, where the investigator considers the AE of concern to be specifically associated with capivasertib.  Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related toxicities are shown in Table 8.  Appropriate and optimal treatment of the toxicity is assumed prior to considering dose modifications.  The Study Physician may be consulted prior to discontinuation of study drug due to toxicities.  Please see Section 8.3.12.3 for the management of capivasertib-specific toxicities including hyperglycaemia, maculo-papular rash and other skin reactions, and diarrhoea."

In participants who are diabetic, it may be beneficial to rule out concomitant aetiologies that could be associated with hyperglycaemia (eg, infections, dehydration, vascular events, glucocorticoids). Participants should be made aware of symptoms of hyperglycaemia (eg, polydipsia and polyuria). Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related hyperglycaemia are shown in Table 9.  In addition, for all grades, participants may receive education on lifestyle changes (eg, a diabetic diet) and consider beginning home glucose monitoring (eg, fasting self-blood glucose monitoring once daily) at the discretion of the investigator.  If glucose home monitoring is instituted, the capivasertib\/placebo treatment decision should be based on the morning fasting glucose value obtained prior to the dose of capivasertib\/placebo. It is recommended that approaches to the management of capivasertib-induced hyperglycaemia include advice from a diabetologist where appropriate (eg, participants with diabetes).  Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies (see below for further guidance).  If a second agent is required, consideration should be given to the intermittent schedule of capivasertib and the pattern of glucose changes (eg, sulphonylureas should be avoided due to the risk of hypoglycaemia secondary to their mechanism of action)."

NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0; SBGM, self-blood glucose monitoring. Use of metformin Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies.  Investigators should exercise caution in the dosing and management of participants receiving the metformin and capivasertib\/placebo combination and must be vigilant for signs of renal impairment and metformin toxicity, such as lactic acidosis and hypoglycaemia, namely: lethargy, hypotension, poor urine output, drowsiness, irritation, tachypnoea, sweating, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Due to the potential interaction of metformin and capivasertib (caused by the inhibition of renal transporters [eg, OCT2] involved in the excretion of metformin), when taking both capivasertib and metformin concurrently, participants should attend the clinic for monitoring of serum creatinine at least once per week for the first 3 weeks after initiation of metformin, then every 3 weeks thereafter. Metformin should only be given on the days when capivasertib\/placebo is also administered (the half-life of capivasertib is approximately 7 to 15 hours) and should be withdrawn when treatment with capivasertib\/placebo is withdrawn, unless otherwise clinically indicated. Consider withholding of metformin on the days when participants are due to have imaging with contrast (in order to reduce the already low risk of lactic acidosis) as per local guidelines. Maculo-papular Rash Dose modifications for capivasertib-related maculo-papular rash, which is the most frequent skin toxicity observed in participants treated with capivasertib, are provided in Table 10.  However, these management guidelines can be used for other skin toxicities at the discretion of the investigator and\/or following consultation with the dermatologist."

BSA, body surface area; NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. Hypersensitivity In the case of hypersensitivity reactions, capivasertib\/placebo should be discontinued, and symptomatic\/supportive therapy should be initiated (including with antihistamines and\/or steroids) as considered appropriate by the investigator\/treating physician.  Drug re-challenge is not recommended; any subsequent consideration on re-challenge with capivasertib at the same or a lower dose, with its potential for recurrence of such or more severe events should be carefully considered against the potential benefits to the individual participant from continuation of capivasertib therapy and agreed with the sponsor.  Further management should follow local guidelines on management of hypersensitivity reactions. Diarrhoea Participants should be instructed to promptly contact investigators if they develop diarrhoea. Alternative aetiologies should be ruled out prior to initiating the dose modifications.  Investigators are recommended to prescribe anti-diarrhoeal treatment at the first visit so that participants can start treatment at the first sign of diarrhoea, should it occur.  Loperamide is the preferred anti-diarrhoeal agent for the management of diarrhoea occurring in participants participating in studies of capivasertib.

Any dose, or frequency of dosing, that exceeds the dose regimen specified in the CSP should be reported as an overdose.  The maximum tolerated dose for capivasertib is 480 mg BD as monotherapy.  Abiraterone must be used according to local prescribing information. Adverse reactions associated with overdose should be treated symptomatically and should be managed appropriately. An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis\/symptoms on the relevant AE modules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module. An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose eCRF module. If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study drug occurs in the course of the study, the investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives immediately, but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 or 5 calendar days for overdoses associated with an SAE (see Section 8.3.9) and within 30 days for all other overdoses. 8.5  Human Biological Samples Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided in the study specific laboratory manual.  Samples should be stored in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  For further details on Handling of Human Biological Samples see Appendix I. Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years from the date of the issue of the CSR in line with consent and local requirements, after which they will be destroyed\/repatriated. PK samples will be disposed of after the Bioanalytical Report finalisation or 6 months after issuance of the draft Bioanalytical Report (whichever is earlier), unless consented for future analyses. PK samples may be disposed of or anonymised by pooling.  Additional analyses may be conducted on the anonymised, pooled PK samples to further evaluate and validate the analytical method.  Any results from such analyses may be reported separately from the CSR.  Anonymised samples will be retained for no more than 5 years after the CSR is finalised. 8.5.1  Pharmacokinetics Blood samples of approximately 2 mL will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of capivasertib as specified in the SoA (Table 2). Samples from participants dosed with placebo will not be analysed (for exceptions, see Section 8.5.1.1).  The randomisation code will be supplied to the bioanalytics team before sample analysis. Results will only be reported for samples shipped within a timeframe for which the stability of capivasertib in the samples has been validated and shown to be acceptable. Samples may be collected at additional time points during the study if warranted and agreed upon between the investigator and the sponsor (eg, for safety reasons).  Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided by the sponsor or analytical test site.  The actual date and time (24-hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded.  The timing of sampling may be altered during the course of the study based on newly available data (eg, to obtain data closer to the time of peak or trough matrix concentrations) to ensure appropriate monitoring. Samples collected for analysis of capivasertib plasma concentrations may also be used to evaluate safety or efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or after the study. Samples will be collected, labelled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual. 8.5.1.1  Determination of Drug Concentration Samples for determination of capivasertib concentration in plasma will be assayed by bioanalytical test sites operated by or on behalf of Clinical Bioanalysis Alliance, AstraZeneca, using an appropriately validated bioanalytical method.  Full details of the analytical method used will be described in a separate bioanalytical report. For each participant in the placebo arm, samples will only be analysed on a \u2018for cause' basis, eg, if no quantifiable concentrations were observed in a participant's samples when the drug was expected to be present. Drug concentration information that may unblind the study will not be reported to investigative sites or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded. Incurred sample reproducibility analysis, if any, will be performed alongside the bioanalysis of the test samples.  The results from the evaluation, if performed, will be reported in a separate Bioanalytical Report. Additional analyses may be conducted on the biological samples to further investigate the presence and\/or identity of drug metabolites.  Any results from such analyses may be reported separately from the CSR. 8.5.2  Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics will not form part of this study. 8.6  Human Biological Sample Biomarkers 8.6.1  Collection of Mandatory Samples for Biomarker Analysis By consenting to participate in the study the subject consents to participate in the mandatory research components of the study. Samples for biomarker research are required and will be collected from all participants in this study as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). Mandatory Tumour Samples Tumour tissue samples from either the primary or metastatic sites (excluding bone metastases and FNA samples), taken as part of routine clinical practice, will be provided for assessment of PTEN status by IHC.  Determination of PTEN status is a requirement for recruitment and only patients with PTEN deficiency as detected by central testing using the Investigational Use Only (IUO) PTEN IHC assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, USA) will be enrolled.  This sample needs to be provided for screening Part 1, and should preferably be a representative FFPE tissue block, that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides, or if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides from the most recently collected tumour tissue.  Further details on tissue specifications are outlined in the Laboratory Manual and the Pathology Testing Manual.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1. In addition to being used for determination of eligibility for this study, the PTEN IHC results are also planned to be used for companion diagnostic test development.  Based on availability of tissue, additional diagnostic test development may be conducted and\/or further additional exploratory biomarkers may be evaluated, which may include but are not limited to, genomic analysis of tumour tissue to identify markers of response and resistance to study drugs.  For this purpose, an optional tumour sample (FFPE block [preferred] or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections) can be provided in screening Part 1.  For screening Part 2, eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) will be required to provide an additional tumour sample (FFPE block [preferred] or 20 [minimum 15] freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  Participants who provided optional additional tumour tissue in screening Part 1 are exempt from providing tumour in screening Part 2.  If fewer slides are available, the patient may still be eligible for the study, after discussion with and approval by the Medical Monitor.  Further details on tissue specifications are outlined in the Laboratory Manual.  China participants will not participate in these exploratory analyses. Mandatory Blood Samples for Exploratory Biomarker Analysis Blood samples will be collected for analysis of ctDNA (see Section 1.3).  The ctDNA samples collected at screening will be analysed for predictive biomarkers of response to treatment and may be used to develop and validate future in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests.  Several ctDNA samples will be taken during treatment and a final sample will be taken at disease progression.  These samples will be used for additional exploratory research which may include but is not limited to interrogation of changes in genetic alterations and potential mechanisms of resistance to treatment. For exploratory biomarker research, blood samples will be collected to provide plasma for circulating soluble factors and whole blood samples will be collected for DNA and RNA biomarkers.  These samples will be taken at multiple timepoints and analysed for a range of oncology and immunological biomarkers that may correlate with drug response.  These biomarkers may include, but are not limited to, panels of cytokines, chemokines and other soluble biomarkers; T-cell receptor repertoire analysis and analysis of gene expression biomarkers associated with immunomodulatory effects. Blood samples for the enumeration of CTCs using CellSearch assay will be collected at baseline, pre-treatment on Cycle 4\/Day 1, and at disease progression.  Blood samples will also be collected at Cycle 1\/Day 1 and on progression for the analysis of biomarkers detectable in CTCs using Epic Sciences assays. Details of sample collection, processing, shipping and storage are detailed in the Laboratory Manual. Blood samples for ctDNA testing, exploratory biomarker research, and CTC testing will not be collected from participants in China. 8.6.2  Collection of Optional Biomarker Samples Participants will sign an informed consent for the optional tumour tissue biopsies. Where possible, every effort should be made to collect optional samples for biomarker research from consenting patients in the study, as outlined in the SoA (see Section 1.3) and as follows: Paired biopsies: a baseline biopsy taken before the initial dosing of study drug at screening or pre-dose on Cycle 1, Day 1, and a biopsy taken on-treatment.  The on-treatment biopsy should be taken at least 4 hours post-dose between Cycle 1, Day 16 and Cycle 1, Day 18.  Biopsies should preferably be collected from the same tumour site.  The exact day, time and site of biopsy collection should be clearly noted in the associated documentation. An additional biopsy obtained at termination of treatment\/disease progression, if applicable. The tumour biopsy procedure will be performed by core needle, under radiological guidance, or surgically if the site of disease is superficial and palpable or visible.  It is mandated that the core biopsy be removed directly from the tumour in situ and not cored from a surgically removed tumour.  This is to ensure the best possible quality of the biopsy, so the blood\/nutrient supply to the tumour is not disrupted prior to biopsy collection.  Collection of tumour cells from fluid such as ascites or pleural effusion is not permitted.  The tumour samples may be analysed for biomarkers including, but not limited to, markers of PI3K\/AKT and AR pathways and treatment-induced changes in immunological markers such as CD8 expressing T-cells and PD-L1 expression. Collection of optional biomarker samples is not applicable for participants in China. 8.6.3  Other Study-related Biomarker Research Already collected samples may be analysed on different biomarkers thought to play a role in prostate cancer including, but not limited to, analysis of tumour tissue and peripheral blood samples for immunological biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression, TCR sequencing and gene expression analysis; chemokines and cytokines, and analysis of genes associated with AKT\/AR signalling in tumour tissue and ctDNA to evaluate their association with observed clinical responses to study drug.  For storage, re-use and destruction of biomarker samples see Section 8.5. 8.7  Optional Genomics Initiative Sample Collection of optional samples for genomics initiative research is also part of this study as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3) and is subject to agreement in the ICF addendum. A 6 mL blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected from participants who have consented to participate in the genetic analysis component of the study.  Participation is optional.  Participants who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the study. Note: Samples for genomics initiative research will not be collected for participants in China. See Appendix J for information regarding the Genomics Initiative genetic sample, including storage and destruction of genetic samples. 8.8  Medical Resource Utilisation and Health Economics The impact of treatment and disease on healthcare resource use will be captured in this study on an event-driven basis. The Hospital Admission (HOSPAD) module will be used to collect information on key health care resource use beyond study-mandated visits.  The site should complete the HOSPAD form at the site at every scheduled clinic visit up to and including the post study treatment discontinuation follow-up visit.  If a participant discontinues study treatment for reasons other than RECIST or PCWG3 progression, the HOSPAD form should continue to be administered until progression has been confirmed.  Study-mandated visits should not be included as a hospital admission. The data may be used as input to cost analyses for example cost utility analysis or cost effectiveness analysis. 9  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 9.1  Statistical Hypotheses The null hypothesis for the primary time-to-event endpoint rPFS, defined as the time from randomisation until the date of objective disease progression (adopting RECIST 1.1 criteria for soft tissue lesions and PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions) or death (from any cause in the absence of progression), is that there is no difference in event rate between capivasertib + abiraterone and placebo + abiraterone.  The intention of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of capivasertib + abiraterone over placebo + abiraterone. 9.2  Sample Size Determination Assuming a true treatment effect HR of 0.70 (this translates to an approximate 18-month improvement in median rPFS over an assumed 43-month median rPFS on abiraterone, assuming rPFS is exponentially distributed), approximately 331 rPFS events must be observed for the study to have 90% power to show a statistically significant difference in rPFS at the 2-sided 5% level, allowing for an interim analysis for efficacy.  The smallest treatment difference that would be statistically significant with 331 events is an rPFS HR of 0.806. Assuming 33% maturity (with maturity defined as the proportion of patients having an event), 1000 participants must be randomised (in a 1:1 ratio).  To randomise approximately 1000 participants, it is expected that approximately 5500 participants will be screened. There will be an interim analysis of rPFS, once approximately 222 (22% maturity) rPFS events have been observed.  With 222 events, a significant result will be declared if the observed rPFS HR is 0.593 or better at this interim analysis with a 2-sided p-value < 0.0001 (approximate relative information fraction = 67%).  The interim analysis on rPFS will be incorporated into the MTP. If the null hypothesis (no rPFS benefit of capivasertib [+ abiraterone backbone] versus placebo [+ abiraterone backbone]) is not rejected, at the final analysis (DCO2), rPFS will be tested at \u03b1 = 0.05 (2-sided). The approximate timing of the interim analysis (DCO1), the occurrence of 222 events, is expected to be at 39 months from the date of First Subject In and the timing of the final analysis (DCO2), the occurrence of 331 events, is expected to be at 52 months from First Subject In.  This is based on exponentially distributed rPFS events times and non-uniform accrual of participants over the 30 months recruitment period. Table 12 summarises the significance level, number of events, critical value, and power at each analysis."

This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the most important endpoints, including the primary and secondary endpoints. 9.4.1  General Considerations Analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representative.  A comprehensive SAP will be developed and finalised before the interim database cut and will describe the participant populations to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data.  This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints.  Any deviations from this plan will be reported in the CSR. 9.4.2  Efficacy Efficacy analyses will be performed based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) (ITT). 9.4.2.1  Primary Endpoint Radiographic PFS is defined in Section 8.1.2.1 as the time from randomisation until the date of objective disease progression (adopting RECIST 1.1 criteria for soft tissue lesions and PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions) or death (from any cause in the absence of progression) together with details of censoring. The effect of capivasertib versus placebo will be tested using a log rank test stratified by the randomisation stratification factors.  If there are insufficient events per strata, some strata will be collapsed following rules that will be pre-specified in the SAP.  The stratification variables in the statistical modelling will be based on the values entered into IWRS at randomisation. From the stratified Cox proportional hazards model (ties = Efron) the HR (capivasertib + abiraterone vs placebo + abiraterone) together with its corresponding 95% CI (calculated using a profile likelihood approach) will be presented.  A HR less than 1 will favour capivasertib + abiraterone. Subgroup analyses will be conducted comparing rPFS between the treatment arms.  The purpose of the subgroup analyses is to assess the consistency of treatment effect across potential or expected prognostic factors. The subgroups defined by the stratification factors (Section 4.1) will be analysed for rPFS. Additional subgroups of interest and analysis methods will be outlined in the SAP. No adjustment to the significance level for testing of subgroups will be made, since all of these subgroup analyses will be considered exploratory and may only be supportive of the primary analysis of PFS. A sensitivity analysis of rPFS as assessed by BICR assessment will also be conducted.  Further sensitivity analyses will be described in the SAP. 9.4.2.2  Key Secondary Endpoints Overall Survival Overall survival is defined in Section 8.1.3 together with details of censoring. Overall survival will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1), including subgroup analyses, and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. TFST TFST is defined in Section 8.1.5 together with details of censoring. TFST will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1) and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. SSE-FS SSE-FS is defined in Section 8.1.6 together with details of censoring. SSE-FS will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1) and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. Time to Pain Progression Time to pain progression (TTPP) is defined in Section 8.1.8.1.  TTPP will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1) and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. 9.4.2.3  Other Secondary Endpoints Time to PSA progression Time to PSA progression is defined in Section 8.1.4 together with details of censoring. Time to PSA progression will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1), and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% confidence interval will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. Time to Castration Resistance TTCR is defined in Section 8.1.7 together with details of censoring. TTCR will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1) and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. PFS2 PFS2 is defined in Section 8.1.2.5 together with details of censoring. PFS2 in the overall population will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1) and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Analysis details will be defined in the SAP. Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) Analysis details will be defined in the SAP. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate Cancer (FACT-P) Analysis details will be defined in the SAP. 9.4.2.4  Exploratory Endpoints Analyses of the following exploratory endpoints will be detailed in the SAP: Time to First Subsequent Chemotherapy, ORR, duration of response, PRO-CTCAE, and EQ-5D. 9.4.3  Safety Safety and tolerability will be assessed in terms of AEs and SAEs, physical examination findings, vital signs (including DBP\/SBP and pulse rate), ECG findings, and laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis parameters).  These will be collected for all participants. Adverse events will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) that will have been released for execution at AstraZeneca\/designee. Safety data will be presented using descriptive statistics unless otherwise specified. Adverse events will be presented for each treatment group by system organ class and preferred term, covering number and percentage of participants reporting at least one event and number of events where appropriate. AEs occurring prior to start of Investigational Product, treatment-emergent AEs, and post-treatment AEs will be presented separately. An overview of AEs will present for each treatment group the number and percentage of participants with any AE, AEs with outcome of death, serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of Investigational Product, as well as AEs leading to Investigational Product dose interruptions and AEs leading to Investigational Product dose reductions. Separate AE tables will be provided taken into consideration relationship as assessed by the investigator, CTCAE grade, seriousness, death and events leading to discontinuation of Investigational Product as well as other action taken related to Investigational Product, events of special interest and other significant adverse events. An additional table will present the number and percentage of participants with the most common AEs. In accordance with the requirements of the FDA, a separate table will present non-serious AEs occurring in more than 5% of participants in any treatment group. Key participant information will be presented for participants with AEs with outcome of death, serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of investigational product. An AE listing for the safety analysis set will cover details for each individual AE. Full details of AE analyses will be provided in the SAP. The following events are considered treatment emergent: AEs with onset date on or after first dose of IMP (ie, capivasertib, placebo, abiraterone) Worsening of pre-existing events on or after first dose of IMP Other safety data including physical examinations, clinical haematology, chemistry, urinalysis, vital signs and ECGs will be summarised using descriptive statistics. 9.4.4  Other Analyses The plasma concentration-time data of capivasertib in combination with abiraterone will be analysed by population PK methods using non-linear mixed-effects modelling.  PK parameters, including variability parameters, will be estimated as data permits.  The influence of intrinsic (eg, ethnicity, gender, age, weight, renal function, and hepatic function) and extrinsic (eg, concomitant medication) factors will be evaluated and exposure-response relationships will be explored.  Details will be outlined in a separate modelling analysis plan and results may be reported separately. PK analyses will be performed based on the PK Analysis Set and any exclusion of data will be documented and justified. Data from this study may be pooled with data from other studies. 9.4.5  Methods for Multiplicity Control In order to preserve the overall type 1 error, the key secondary endpoints of OS, TFST, SSE-FS, and time to pain progression will be tested following a MTP (Figure 3).  Each endpoint will have its own spending function.  Other than for rPFS, the alpha allocation for the secondary endpoints will be controlled at the interim and\/or the final analysis timepoints by using the Lan-DeMets spending function (Lan and DeMets 1983) that approximates the O'Brien-Fleming approach, where the significance level applied at the interim analysis depends upon the proportion of information (ie, information fraction) available.  Each endpoint will be tested according to the group-sequential Holm variable (GSHv) procedure (Ye et al 2013). The MTP will be detailed in the SAP. Figure 3  Multiple Testing Procedure None DCO Data cut-off; OS Overall survival; rPFS radiographic progression-free survival, SSE-FS Symptomatic skeletal eventfree survival; TFST Time to first subsequent therapy; TTPP Time to pain progression. 9.5  Interim Analyses The primary endpoint of rPFS, based on investigator assessment using RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and PCWG3 (bone) will be tested after 222 (22% maturity) rPFS events have occurred. At the interim analysis (first DCO [DCO1]), rPFS will be tested at \u03b1 = 0.0001 (2 sided) (assuming 67.0% information fraction); the critical value is HR = 0.593 with 222 rPFS events. Time to first subsequent therapy (TFST) will be analysed at DCO1 and DCO2 (final rPFS analysis).  Overall survival, SSE-FS, and TTPP will be analysed at DCO2 and DCO3, approximately 12 months after the final rPFS analysis at DCO2. The SAP will describe the planned interim analyses in greater detail. 9.6  Data Monitoring Committee An IDMC will be established to assess the safety of capivasertib in an unblinded manner.  The IDMC will be responsible for reviewing the safety data accruing in the study at regular intervals, and the interim efficacy analysis to provide a recommendation to AstraZeneca whether the study should continue unchanged, be stopped, or be modified in any way.  The IDMC will consist of at least 2 physicians with expertise in prostate cancer and one biostatistician.  Further information on the IDMC and schedule of meetings will be defined in the IDMC Charter. 10  SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  Appendix A  ECOG\/WHO Performance Status The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)\/World Health Organization (WHO) performance status scale is presented in Table 14."

Appendix B  Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations B 1  Regulatory and Ethical Considerations This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and with the following: Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines Applicable ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines Applicable laws and regulations AstraZeneca will be responsible for obtaining the required authorisations to conduct the study from the concerned Regulatory Authority.  This responsibility may be delegated to a CRO, but the accountability remains with AstraZeneca. The protocol, protocol amendments, ICFs, Investigator Brochure, and other relevant documents (eg, advertisements) must be submitted to an IRB\/IEC by the investigator and reviewed and approved by the IRB\/IEC before the study is initiated. Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB\/IEC and applicable Regulatory Authority approval before implementation of changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study participants. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation.  The sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs\/IECs, and investigators. For all studies except those utilising medical devices investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB\/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. B 2  Financial Disclosure Investigators and sub-investigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information as requested to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities.  Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study. B 3  Informed Consent Process The investigator or his\/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the participant or their legally authorised representative and answer all questions regarding the study. Participants must be informed that their participation is voluntary, and they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason during the study.  Participants or their legally authorised representative will be required to sign a statement of informed consent that meets the requirements of 21 CFR 50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements, where applicable, and the IRB\/IEC or study centre, as well as any locally required privacy act document prior to performing any protocol-specific procedures including screening(s) and baseline evaluations.  A 2-stage process applies in this study and two ICFs are obtained according to the Schedule of Assessments (Section 1.3). The medical record must include a statement that written informed consent was obtained before any protocol-specific procedures were performed to the participant and the date the written consent was obtained.  The authorised person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF(s). Participants must be re-consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their participation in the study. A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the participant or the participant's legally authorised representative. If a participant declines to participate in any voluntary exploratory genetic research component of the study, there will be no penalty or loss of benefit to the participant and they will not be excluded from other aspects of the study. A participant who is rescreened is required to sign another ICF (relevant to the part the participant was consented to). The ICF will contain a separate section that addresses the use of remaining mandatory samples for optional exploratory research.  The investigator or authorised designee will explain to each participant the objectives of the exploratory research.  Participants will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason during the storage period.  The participant will give a separate agreement to allow any remaining specimens to be used for exploratory research.  Participants who decline to participate in this optional research will indicate this in the ICF. If a participant withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will be disposed of\/destroyed, and the action documented.  If samples already have been analysed at the time of the request, AstraZeneca will not be obliged to destroy the results of this research. B 4  Data Protection Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor.  Any participant records or datasets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names or any information which would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred. The participant must be informed that their personal study-related data will be used by the sponsor in accordance with local data protection law.  The level of disclosure and use of their data must also be explained to the participant in the informed consent The participant must be informed that their medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authorised personnel appointed by the sponsor, by appropriate IRB\/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities. B 5  Committees Structure The IDMC will be responsible for reviewing the unblinded safety data accruing in the study at regular intervals, and for reviewing the efficacy interim analysis.  The IDMC will consist of at least 2 physicians with expertise in prostate cancer and one biostatistician, and will be formed prior to the randomisation of the first participant.  Details will be described in the IDMC Charter. The composition of the study Steering Committee will be described in a Charter. B 6  Dissemination of Clinical Study Data A description of this clinical study will be available on http:\/\/astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com and http:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov as will the summary of the Study D361BC00001 results when they are available.  The clinical trial and\/or summary of Study D361BC00001 results may also be available on other websites according to the regulations of the countries in which Study D361BC00001 is conducted. B 7  Data Quality Assurance All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on eCRF unless transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data).  The investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or electronically signing the eCRF. The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the information entered in the eCRF. The investigator must permit study-related monitoring, audits, IRB\/IEC review, and regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. Monitoring details describing strategy (eg, risk-based initiatives in operations and quality such as Risk Management and Mitigation Strategies and Analytical Risk-Based Monitoring), methods, responsibilities and requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on-site monitoring) are provided in the Monitoring Plan. The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including quality checking of the data. The sponsor assumes accountability for actions delegated to other individuals (eg, Contract Research Organisations). Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the eCRF by authorised site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained by the investigator in accordance with local regulations unless institutional policies require a longer retention period.  No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the sponsor.  No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the sponsor. B 8  Source Documents Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the integrity of the data collected.  Source documents are filed at the investigator's site. Data reported on the eCRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained.  The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study.  Also, current medical records must be available. B 9  Study and Site Start and Closure The study start date is the date on which the clinical study will be open for recruitment of participants.  The first act of recruitment is the date of first participant enrolment and will be the study start date. The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor.  Study sites will be closed upon study completion.  A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed.  The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are not limited to: Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB\/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator Discontinuation of further study intervention development If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the investigators, the IECs\/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any contract research organisation(s) used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements.  The investigator shall promptly inform the participant and should assure appropriate participant therapy and\/or follow-up. Participants from terminated sites will have the opportunity to be transferred to another site to continue the study. B 10  Publication Policy The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings.  If this is foreseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor before submission.  This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments. The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results.  In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally support publication of multicentre studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data.  In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements. Appendix C  Guidance Regarding Potential Interactions of Capivasertib with Concomitant Medications C 1  Drugs that May Influence Capivasertib Pharmacokinetics Based on results from in vitro studies, capivasertib is a substrate of CYP3A4, although data suggests that glucuronidation may be the major metabolic route.  Co-administration of some CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase exposure to capivasertib and hence potentially affect toxicity, while CYP3A4 inducers may decrease the exposure to capivasertib and may potentially affect efficacy. The following lists (Table 15) are not intended to be exhaustive and a similar restriction will apply to other agents that are known to modulate CYP3A4 activity.  Appropriate medical judgment is required.  Please contact AstraZeneca with any queries you have on this issue."

Please refer to full prescribing information for all drugs prior to co-administration with capivasertib. C 3  Guidance for Statins Atorvastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin should be avoided due to the potential for increased exposure through inhibition of CYP3A4 by capivasertib (Table 16). Fluvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin are minimally influenced by CYP3A4 inhibitors, conveying a relatively low potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions via this mechanism. Capivasertib also has a potential to inhibit the organic-anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP-1B1) transporter, which is implicated in the distribution and clearance of many of the statins.  The predicted increase in the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) is 1.3-fold for pravastatin and 1.5-fold for rosuvastatin.  It is, therefore, recommended that doses of pravastatin be capped to 40 mg once daily and rosuvastatin be capped to 10 mg once daily when combined with capivasertib, including 1 week prior to capivasertib administration and for 1 week following discontinuation of capivasertib. In summary, rosuvastatin (up to 10 mg once daily), pravastatin (up to 40 mg once daily) and fluvastatin are appropriate agents to be used in participants included in capivasertib studies who require statin therapy. C 4  Additional Resources For additional inhibitors, inducers and substrates please refer to: https:\/\/drug-interactions.medicine.iu.edu\/Clinical-Table.aspx https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/Drugs\/DevelopmentApprovalProcess\/DevelopmentResources\/DrugIntera ctionsLabeling\/ucm093664.htm Appendix D  Highly Effective Methods of Contraception Male participants should use barrier contraception (ie, condoms) from the time of screening until 16 weeks after discontinuation of capivasertib\/placebo.  Female partners of male participants should also use a highly effective form of contraception if they are of childbearing potential. Highly effective methods of contraception include: Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, intravaginal, or transdermal, Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, injectable, or implantable, Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), Bilateral tubal occlusion, Male partner sterilisation (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate), True abstinence (ie, not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of study treatment and the treatment washout period is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control). Acceptable method of contraception: Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical\/vault caps) with spermicidal foam\/gel\/film\/cream\/suppository. It is not known whether capivasertib has the capacity to affect the metabolism of hormonal contraceptives, so hormonal contraception should also be combined with a barrier method of contraception. Appendix E  Guidelines for Evaluation of Objective Tumour Response Using RECIST 1.1 Criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) in Soft Tissue and PCWG3 (Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3) in Bone Lesions E 1  INTRODUCTION This appendix details the implementation of RECIST 1.1 Guidelines (Eisenhauer et al 2009) and PCWG 3 guidelines (Scher et al 2016) for Study D361BC00001 with regards to assessment of tumour burden including protocol-specific requirements for this study. E 2  ASSESSMENT OF SOFT TISSUE DISEASE USING RECIST 1.1 CRITERIA Definition of Measurable, Non-measurable, Target, and Non-target Lesions In this study, bone lesions, with the exception of lytic lesions with a soft tissue component, will not be included in the RECIST assessment, neither as target lesions (TL), non-target lesions (NTL), or new lesions.  Bone lesions will be followed-up using a modified version of the PCWG3 criteria and the guidelines for bone lesion assessments are defined in the bone lesion section of this appendix (Section E 3). Measurable: A lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline as \u2265 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis \u2265 15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements. Non-measurable: All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with \u2265 10 to < 15 mm short axis at baseline*). Truly non-measurable lesions include the following: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural\/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses\/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable by CT or MRI. Previously irradiated lesions** * Nodes with < 10 mm short axis are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed as NTL. ** Localised post-radiation changes which affect lesion sizes may occur.  Therefore, lesions that have been previously irradiated will not be considered measurable and must be selected as NTL at baseline and followed up as part of the NTL assessment. Special Cases: Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability.  Blastic lesions are considered non-measurable. Cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for measurability from a radiological point of view, but if non-cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these should be selected as target lesions. Target Lesions: A maximum of 5 measurable lesions (with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ), representative of all lesions involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as TL at baseline. Non-Target Lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should be identified as NTL at baseline (except bone lesions, which will be assessed as defined in bone lesion section of this appendix [Section E 3]). Methods of Assessment The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterise each identified and recorded lesion at baseline and during follow-up visits. A summary of the methods to be used for RECIST assessment is provided below and those excluded from tumour assessments for this study are highlighted, with the rationale provided."

In Study D361BC00001, it is recommended that CT examinations of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be used to assess tumour burden at baseline and follow-up visits.  CT examination with intravenous (iv) contrast media administration is the preferred method.  MRI should be used where CT is not feasible or is medically contraindicated.  For brain lesion assessment, MRI is the preferred method. Every effort should be made to maintain the radiologic imaging modality used at baseline throughout subsequent assessments. Chest X-ray In Study D361BC00001, chest X-ray assessment will not be used for assessment of TL as they will be assessed by CT examination or MRI examination.  Chest X-ray can, however, be used to assess NTL and to identify the presence of new lesions. Ultrasound In Study D361BC00001, ultrasound examination will not be used for assessment of TL and NTL as it is not a reproducible method, does not provide an accurate assessment of tumour size and it is subjective and operator dependent.  Ultrasound examination can, however, be used to identify the presence of new lesions.  If new clinical symptoms occur and an ultrasound is performed, then new lesions should be confirmed by CT or MRI examination. Endoscopy and Laparoscopy In Study D361BC00001, endoscopy and laparoscopy will not be used for tumour assessments as they are not validated in the context of tumour assessment. Tumour Markers In Study D361BC00001, tumour markers will not be used for tumour response assessments as per RECIST 1.1. In this study, PSA levels are being collected for separate analysis; however, the results will not contribute to tumour response based on RECIST 1.1 assessment. Cytology and Histology In Study D361BC00001, histology and cytology will not be used for tumour response assessments as per RECIST 1.1 and tumour response assessments will be performed on radiological criteria only. FDG-PET Scan In Study D361BC00001 FDG-PET scans may be used as a method for identifying new lesions, according with the following algorithm: New lesions will be recorded where there is positive FDG uptake* not present on baseline FDG-PET scan or in a location corresponding to a new lesion on CT\/MRI at the same follow-up visit.  If there is no baseline FDG-PET scan available, and no evidence of new lesions on CT\/MRI scans then follow-up CT\/MRI assessments should be continued, scheduled as per protocol or clinically indicated, in order to confirm new lesions. * A positive FDG-PET scan lesion should be reported only when an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue is observed. Tumour Response Evaluation Schedule of Evaluation Baseline assessments should encompass all areas of known predilection for metastases in the disease under evaluation and should additionally investigate areas that may be involved based on signs and symptoms of individual participants and should be performed no more than 28 days before the start of study treatment.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) after randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) or modified PCWG3 (bone).  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be adequately imaged at follow-up. If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their originally scheduled visits.  This schedule is to be followed in order to minimise any unintentional bias caused by some participants being assessed at a different frequency than other participants. Target Lesions (TL) Documentation of Target Lesions A maximum of 5 measurable lesions, with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ (including lymph nodes), representative of all lesions involved should be identified as TL at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (longest diameter for non-nodal lesions or short axis for nodal lesions), but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected. The site and location of each TL should be documented as well as the longest diameter for non-nodal lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes).  All measurements should be recorded in millimetres.  At baseline the sum of the diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters.  At follow-up visits the sum of diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as the follow-up sum of diameters. Special Cases: For TL measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the longest diameter.  For pathological lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the short axis. If the CT\/MRI slice thickness used is > 5 mm, the minimum size of measurable disease at baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan. If a lesion has completely disappeared, the longest diameter should be recorded as 0 mm. If a TL splits into 2 or more parts, then record the sum of the diameters of those parts. If 2 or more TL merge, then the sum of the diameters of the combined lesion should be recorded for 1 of the lesions and 0 mm recorded for the other lesion(s). If a TL is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned.  If an accurate measure can be given, this should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm. If a TL cannot be measured accurately due to it being too large, provide an estimate of the size of the lesion. When a TL has had any intervention eg, radiotherapy, embolisation, surgery etc., during the study, the size of the TL should still be provided where possible. Evaluation of Target Lesions This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumour visit response for TL."

New Lesions Details of any new soft tissue lesions will also be recorded with the date of assessment.  The presence of 1 or more new lesions is assessed as progression. A lesion identified at a follow up assessment in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumour. If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumour assessments should be continued until the new lesion has been confirmed.  If repeat scans confirm there is a new lesion, then the progression date should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

E 3  ASSESSMENT OF BONE LESION PROGRESSION USING PCWG3 CRITERIA A modified version of PCWG3 will be used in this study.  The deviation from the PCWG3 guideline is that for all visits after the first scan post-baseline; no confirmatory scan is requested to assess PD.  Bone lesions will be assessed by bone scan and will not be part of the RECIST v1.1 malignant soft tissue assessment. Method of Assessment Bone lesions identified on a whole-body isotopic bone scan at baseline should be recorded and followed by the same method as per baseline assessment. In Study D361BC00001, isotopic bone scans will be used as a method of assessment to identify the presence of new bone lesions at follow-up visits.  New lesions will be recorded where a positive and unequivocal hot-spot that was not present on the baseline bone scan assessment is identified on a bone scan performed at any time during the study.  The investigator should consider the positive hot-spot to be a significant new site of malignant disease and represent true disease progression in order to record the new lesion. Tumour Progression Evaluation Schedule of the Evaluation Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before the start of study treatment.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) after randomisation until objective disease progression assessed by investigator as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) or PCWG3 (bone). If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their originally scheduled visits.  This schedule is to be followed in order to minimise any unintentional bias caused by some participants being assessed at a different frequency than other participants. Documentation of Lesions All bone lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified at baseline.  Their status should be followed at subsequent visits.  At each visit an overall assessment of the bone lesion progression should be recorded by the investigator.  This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine and record bone progression at the investigational site at each visit. Progression on a bone scan is identified using modified PCWG3 criteria, by having 2 or more new metastatic bone lesions: For patients without progression at the first visit after baseline, the scan from this first visit after baseline now serves as new reference for all subsequent scans, ie, assuming all visits are acquired according to schedule all bone scans after Week 16 are compared to the Week 16 scan. The requirements for determination and confirmation of radiographic progression by either bone scan (bone progression) or CT\/MRI (soft tissue progression) are summarised in Table 22."

It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. During the course of the study the investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry.  The investigator is responsible for determining whether a participant meets potential PHL criteria at any point during the study. All sources of laboratory data are appropriate for the determination of PHL and HL events; this includes samples taken at scheduled study visits and other visits including central and all local laboratory evaluations even if collected outside of the study visits; for example, PHL criteria could be met by an elevated ALT from a central laboratory and\/or elevated TBL from a local laboratory. The investigator will also review Adverse Event data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevations in liver biochemistry) for possible PHL events. The investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy's Law (HL) criteria are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP). The investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL\/HL cases and for reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events (AEs) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes. G 2  Definitions Potential Hy's Law (PHL) Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) \u2265 3x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) together with Total Bilirubin (TBL) \u2265 2xULN at any point during the study following the start of study medication irrespective of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP). Hy's Law (HL) AST or ALT \u2265 3x ULN together with TBL \u2265 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, can be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug. For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur. G 3  Identification of Potential Hy's Law Cases In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any participant who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in combination: ALT \u2265 3xULN AST \u2265 3xULN TBL \u2265 2xULN The investigator will without delay review each new laboratory report and if the identification criteria are met will: Notify the AstraZeneca representative Determine whether the participant meets PHL criteria (see Section G 2 for definition) by reviewing laboratory reports from all previous visits Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory eCRF G 4  Follow-up G 4.1  Potential Hy's Law Criteria Not Met If the participant does not meet PHL criteria the investigator will: Inform the AstraZeneca representative that the participant has not met PHL criteria. Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance provided in the Clinical Study Protocol. G 4.2  Potential Hy's Law Criteria Met If the participant does meet PHL criteria the investigator will: Notify the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central Study Team. Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the investigator will report the case as an SAE of Potential Hy's Law; serious criteria \u2018Important medical event' and causality assessment \u2018yes\/related' according to CSP process for SAE reporting. For participants that met PHL criteria prior to starting IMP, the investigator is not required to submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change in the participant's condition. The Study Physician contacts the investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an approach for the study participants' follow-up (including any further laboratory testing) and the continuous review of data. Subsequent to this contact the investigator will: Monitor the participant until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated.  Completes follow-up SAE Form as required. Investigate the aetiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as discussed with the Study Physician. Complete the three Liver eCRF Modules as information becomes available. #A \u2018significant' change in the participant's condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, or total bilirubin) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the investigator, this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty. G 5  Review and Assessment of Potential Hy's Law Cases The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met. As soon as possible after the biochemistry abnormality was initially detected, the Study Physician contacts the investigator in order to review available data and agree on whether there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the IMP, to ensure timely analysis and reporting to health authorities within 15 calendar days from date PHL criteria was met.  The AstraZeneca Global Clinical Lead or equivalent and Global Safety Physician will also be involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as appropriate. According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the investigator will follow the instructions below. Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE: If the alternative explanation is not an AE, record the alternative explanation on the appropriate eCRF. If the alternative explanation is an AE\/SAE: update the previously submitted Potential Hy's Law SAE and AE eCRFs accordingly with the new information (reassessing event term; causality and seriousness criteria) following the AstraZeneca standard processes. If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL elevations other than the IMP: Send updated SAE (report term \u2018Hy's Law') according to AstraZeneca standard processes. The \u2018Medically Important' serious criterion should be used if no other serious criteria apply. As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of \u2018related' should be assigned. If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 15 calendar days in obtaining the information necessary to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made: Provides any further update to the previously submitted SAE of Potential Hy's Law, (report term now \u2018Hy's Law case') ensuring causality assessment is related to IMP and seriousness criteria is medically important, according to CSP process for SAE reporting. Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine whether HL criteria are still met.  Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report following CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review and amending the reported term if an alternative explanation for the liver biochemistry elevations is determined.

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a deterioration of a pre-existing medical occurrence.  An AE may occur at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no Study treatment has been administered. H 2  Definitions of Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run-in, treatment, washout, follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: Results in death Is immediately life-threatening Requires in-participant hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the participant or may require medical treatment to prevent one of the outcomes listed above The above instruction applies only when the malignant tumour event in question is a new malignant tumour (ie, it is not the tumour for which entry into the study is a criterion and that is being treated by the IP under study and is not the development of new or progression of existing metastasis to the tumour under study).  Malignant tumours that - as part of normal, if rare, progression - undergo transformation (eg, Richter's transformation of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia into diffuse large B cell lymphoma) should not be considered a new malignant tumour. Life-threatening \u2018Life-threatening' means that the participant was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred, or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the participant's death.  \u2018Life-threatening' does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure). Hospitalisation Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospital admissions and\/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the participant was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study. Important Medical Event or Medical Treatment Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situations where important medical events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death, hospitalisation, disability or incapacity but may jeopardise the participant or may require medical treatment to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.  These should usually be considered as serious. Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical judgement must be used. Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone treatment Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N-acetylcysteine Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation Development of drug dependency or drug abuse Intensity Rating Scale The grading scales found in the revised National Cancer Institute CTCAE latest version will be utilised for all events with an assigned CTCAE grading.  For those events without assigned CTCAE grades, the recommendation in the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, moderate and severe events into CTCAE grades should be used.  A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program website (http:\/\/ctep.cancer.gov).  The applicable version of CTCAE should be described clearly. It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Appendix H 2.  An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Appendix H 2.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix H 2. H 3  A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question When making an assessment of causality consider the following factors when deciding if there is a \u2018reasonable possibility' that an AE may have been caused by the drug. Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the participant actually received the suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug? Consistency with known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological properties? De-challenge experience.  Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect drug? No alternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors. Re-challenge experience.  Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge. Laboratory tests.  A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship. In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: Is this a recognised feature of overdose of the drug? Is there a known mechanism? Causality of \u2018related' is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a \u2018reasonable possibility' of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expression \u2018reasonable possibility' of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough information to make an informed judgment.  With no available facts or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, the event(s) will be assessed as \u2018not related'. Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility. H 4  Medication Error For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study drug that either causes harm to the participant or has the potential to cause harm to the participant. A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or participant. Medication error includes situations where an error. occurred was identified and intercepted before the participant received the drug did not occur, but circumstances were recognised that could have led to an error Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors: Drug name confusion Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to the participant Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of administration Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet dissolved in water when it should be taken as a solid tablet Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature Wrong participant received the medication (excluding IWRS errors) Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IWRS errors) Examples of events that do not require reporting as medication errors in clinical studies: Errors related to or resulting from IWRS - including those which lead to one of the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error Participant accidentally missed drug dose(s) eg, forgot to take medication Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose) Participant failed to return unused medication or empty packaging None Capivasertib (AZD5363) Errors related to background and rescue medication, or standard of care medication in open label studies, even if an AstraZeneca product Medication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the medication error.  Appendix I  Handling of Human Biological Samples I 1  Chain of Custody A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle. The investigator at each centre keeps full traceability of collected biological samples from the participants while in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate) and records relevant processing information related to the samples whilst at site. The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps record of receipt of arrival and onward shipment or disposal. AstraZeneca or delegated representatives will keep oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring of study sites, auditing or process checks, and contractual requirements of external laboratory providers. Samples retained for further use will be stored in the AstraZeneca-assigned biobanks or other sample archive facilities and will be tracked by the appropriate AstraZeneca Team during for the remainder of the sample life cycle. If required, AstraZeneca will ensure that remaining biological samples are returned to the site according to local regulations or at the end of the retention period, whichever is the sooner. Procedures for biobanking samples as described above will be not applicable to China, and all residual sample from testing in China will be managed as per all applicable local regulations. I 2  Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Donated Biological Samples If a participant withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will be disposed of\/destroyed\/repatriated, and the action documented.  If samples are already analysed, AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy the results of this research. Following withdrawal of consent for biological samples, further study participation should be considered in relation to the withdrawal processes outlined in the informed consent. The investigator: Ensures participant's withdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is highlighted immediately to AstraZeneca or delegate. Ensures that relevant human biological samples from that participant, if stored at the study site, are immediately identified, disposed of as appropriate, and the action documented. Ensures that the participant and AstraZeneca are informed about the sample disposal. AstraZeneca ensures the organisation(s) holding the samples is\/are informed about the withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of or repatriated as appropriate, and the action documented and study site notified. I 3  International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) 6.2 Guidance Document LABELLING AND SHIPMENT OF BIOHAZARD SAMPLES International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) (https:\/\/www.iata.org\/whatwedo\/cargo\/dgr\/Pages\/download.aspx) classifies infectious substances into 3 categories: Category A, Category B or Exempt Category A Infectious Substances are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals. Category A pathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus.  Infectious substances meeting these criteria which cause disease in humans or both in humans and animals must be assigned to UN 2814.  Infectious substances which cause disease only in animals must be assigned to UN 2900: Category B Infectious Substances are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in Category A.  Category B pathogens are eg, Hepatitis A, C, D, and E viruses.  They are assigned the following UN number and proper shipping name UN 3373 - Biological Substance, Category B are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650 Exempt - Substances which do not contain infectious substances or substances which are unlikely to cause disease in humans or animals are not subject to these Regulations unless they meet the criteria for inclusion in another class. Clinical study samples will fall into Category B or exempt under IATA regulations Clinical study samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient temperature in IATA 650 compliant packaging (https:\/\/www.iata.org\/whatwedo\/cargo\/dgr\/Documents\/DGR-60-EN-PI650.pdf). Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods specification for the dry-ice content Appendix J  Optional Genomics Initiative Sample J 1  Use\/analysis of DNA AstraZeneca intends to collect and store DNA for genetic research to explore how genetic variations may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis of diseases, and the response to medications.  This genetic research may lead to better understanding of diseases, better diagnosis of diseases or other improvements in health care and to the discovery of new diagnostics, treatments or medications.  Therefore, where local regulations and IRB\/IEC allow, a blood sample will be collected for DNA analysis from consenting participants. This optional genetic research may consist of the analysis of the structure of the participant's DNA, ie, the entire genome. The results of genetic analyses may be reported in a separate study summary. The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality. The samples will be retained while research on capivasertib continues but no longer than 15 years or other period as per local requirements. J 2  Genetic Research Plan and Procedures Selection of Genetic Research Population All participants will be asked to participate in this genetic research, except for China participants.  Samples for genomics initiative research will not be collected for participants in China.  Participation is voluntary and if a participant declines to participate there will be no penalty or loss of benefit.  The participant will not be excluded from any aspect of the main study. Inclusion Criteria For inclusion in this genetic research, participants must fulfil all of the inclusion criteria described in the main body of the Clinical Study Protocol and: Provide informed consent for the Genomics Initiative sampling and analyses. Exclusion Criteria Exclusion from this genetic research may be for any of the exclusion criteria specified in the main study or any of the following: Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion in 120 days of genetic sample collection Withdrawal of Consent for Genetic Research Participants may withdraw from this genetic research at any time, independent of any decision concerning participation in other aspects of the main study.  Voluntary withdrawal will not prejudice further treatment.  Procedures for withdrawal are outlined in Section 7.2 of the main Clinical Study Protocol. Collection of Samples for Genetic Research A 6 mL blood sample for this genetic research will be obtained from the participants pre-dose on Cycle 1, Day 1, after randomisation.  Although DNA is stable, early sample collection is preferred to avoid introducing bias through excluding participants who may withdraw due to an adverse event (AE).  If for any reason the sample is not drawn at Cycle 1, Day 1, it may be taken at any visit until the last study visit.  Only one sample should be collected per participant for genetics during the study. Coding and Storage of DNA Samples The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genetic analysis are important to maintain participant confidentiality.  Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years, from the date of last participant last visit, after which they will be destroyed.  DNA is a finite resource that is used up during analyses.  Samples will be stored and used until no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached. An additional second code will be assigned to the sample either before or at the time of DNA extraction replacing the information on the sample tube.  Thereafter, the sample will be identifiable only by the second, unique number.  This number is used to identify the sample and corresponding data at the AstraZeneca genetics laboratories, or at the designated organisation.  No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any person (AstraZeneca employee or designated organisations working with the DNA). The link between the participant enrolment\/randomisation code and the second number will be maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at AstraZeneca or designated organisations.  The link will be used to identify the relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitate correlation of genotypic results with clinical data, allow regulatory audit, and permit tracing of samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of consent. Ethical and Regulatory Requirements The principles for ethical and regulatory requirements for the study, including this genetics research component, are outlined in Appendix B. Informed Consent The genetic component of this study is optional and the participant may participate in other components of the main study without participating in this genetic component.  To participate in the genetic component of the study the participant must sign and date both the consent form for the main study and the addendum for the Genomics Initiative component of the study.  Copies of both signed and dated consent forms must be given to the participant and the original filed at the study centre.  The Principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is given freely and that the participant understands that they may freely withdrawal from the genetic aspect of the study at any time. Participant Data Protection AstraZeneca will not provide individual genotype results to participants, any insurance company, any employer, their family members, general physician unless required to do so by law. Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked to the identity of the participant.  In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a participant.  For example, in the case of a medical emergency, an AstraZeneca Physician or an investigator might know a participant's identity and also have access to his or her genetic data.  Regulatory authorities may require access to the relevant files, though the participant's medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate. Data Management Any genetic data generated in this study will be stored at a secure system at AstraZeneca and\/or designated organisations to analyse the samples. AstraZeneca and its designated organisations may share summary results (such as genetic differences from groups of individuals with a disease) from this genetic research with other researchers, such as hospitals, academic organisations, or health insurance companies.  This can be done by placing the results in scientific databases, where they can be combined with the results of similar studies to learn even more about health and disease.  The researchers can only use this information for health-related research purposes.  Researchers may see summary results, but they will not be able to see individual participant data or any personal identifiers. Some or all of the clinical datasets from the main study may be merged with the genetic data in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database.

The modality of the cardiac function assessments must be consistent within subject ie, if echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment and a follow-up assessment if clinically indicated, then echocardiogram should also be used for subsequent scans.  Participants should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible. c Participants will be required to provide the most recently collected tumour sample (bone metastases or Fine Needle Aspirate [FNA] samples will not be accepted), collected as part of routine clinical practice.  Availability of a tumour sample is mandatory for all patients to enrol in the study for the determination of PTEN status by IHC.  A representative FFPE tissue block that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides must be provided, or, if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual and Pathology Testing Manual.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1; no additional slides will be collected for screening Part 1 or Part 2. d Optional tumour sample: FFPE block (preferred) or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections can be provided.  These slides will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/ or diagnostic test development.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual and Pathology Testing Manual. e Not applicable for China participants. f Eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) are required to provide an additional tumour sample FFPE block (preferred) or 20 (minimum 15) freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  This sample will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/or diagnostic test development.  Patients who provided optional tissue in screening Part 1 are exempt from this requirement.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. g Blood sample for determination of PSA.  Mandatory for all participants on study.  Samples to be collected both at screening and at Cycle 1, Day 1. h Tumour assessment will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a whole-body bone scan.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before randomisation, and ideally should be performed as close as possible to the start of study treatment. i BPI-SF and BFI baseline assessments to be completed by the participant in a consecutive 7-day period during screening (only after PTEN deficiency is confirmed) before randomisation (not required to be at site). j In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs\/SAEs must be reported.

None j Where possible and with consent, participants may be requested to provide a tumour biopsy at tumour progression. k Tumour assessment will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a whole-body bone scan.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) relative to the date of randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), regardless of discontinuation of study treatment (eg, discontinuation due to toxicity or clinical progression) or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy.  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged.  If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at the participant's scheduled visits.  It is important to follow the imaging assessment schedule as closely as possible; however, tumour assessment can be performed at any time when disease progression is clinically suspected.  For participants who have at least 2 new bone lesions appearing on the first post-baseline scan, confirmation of progression will be required by an additional bone scan showing 2 or more new lesions compared to the first post-baseline bone scan at least 6 weeks later (for further detail please see Appendix E). l For the BPI-SF and BFI, the C1D1 assessment is part of the 7-day diaries completed at screening (see Table 1). m The PRO-CTCAE will only be administered where a linguistically validated version exists for a country. n In addition to regular contacts at 12-week intervals, participants will be contacted in the 7 days following a specified date (data cut-off date) for survival analysis. o Participants will enter the PFS2 follow-up period once the participant has discontinued study treatment due to progressive disease by RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue lesions and\/or PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions.  In the survival follow-up period following PFS, all subsequent cancer therapies and vital status will be documented at least every 12 weeks until death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first.

None 2  INTRODUCTION Capivasertib (AZD5363), a novel pyrrolopyrimidine-derived compound, is a potent, selective inhibitor of the kinase activity of all 3 isoforms of AKT (Davies et al 2012).  AstraZeneca is developing capivasertib for use in combination with other anticancer agents for a range of therapeutic indications, including prostate cancer and breast cancer. The AKT serine\/threonine protein kinases (AKT1, AKT2, AKT3) are key downstream effectors of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway, mediating cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, and are activated in a wide range of malignancies (Lindsley 2010).  AKT activation in tumours is largely due to input from other signalling pathways upstream of AKT, including loss of PTEN function and mutations in the catalytic subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) (Yi and Lauring 2015). Investigators should be familiar with the current capivasertib Investigator's Brochure (IB). 2.1  Study Rationale This Phase 3 study is designed to compare capivasertib versus placebo, administered in combination with abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) and ADT as a treatment in patients with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC with tumour tissue characterised by PTEN deficiency.  The rationale for conducting the study is supported by the following: The important unmet medical need in this setting The capivasertib mechanism of action and nonclinical data with capivasertib Clinical data from a study with ipatasertib, an AKT inhibitor with a similar mechanism of action to capivasertib, given in combination with abiraterone in patients with prostate cancer. The background to the rationale is summarised below in Section 2.2. 2.2  Background Prostate cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer in men and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.  An estimated 1.3 million men worldwide were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2018, accounting for 13% of the cancers diagnosed in men.  With an estimated 358,989 deaths in 2018, prostate cancer is the fifth leading cause of death from cancer in men (6.7% of the total deaths from cancer in men) (Globocan 2018). In the advanced disease setting, ADT with either orchiectomy or medical castration with GnRH analogues is highly effective in shrinking tumour burden, decreasing PSA levels, and enhancing quality of life.  Recent studies demonstrated the benefits (including improved survival) in patients with mHSPC of adding docetaxel (Gravis et al 2016, James et al 2016, Sweeney et al 2015) or the androgen biosynthesis inhibitor abiraterone (Fizazi et al 2017, James et al 2017, Mottet et al 2018) to ADT.  Other NHAs, enzalutamide and apalutamide, have also demonstrated benefit in this population (Armstrong et al 2019, Chi et al 2019, Davis et al 2019).  Unfortunately, despite the benefits of these combination therapies, mHSPC inevitably progresses to a castration-resistant phenotype, which is not yet curable, with 90% of overall mortality attributable to the underlying malignant disease (Scher et al 2015). Patients with de novo mHSPC are at higher risk of progressing to a castration-resistant disease state than those with prostate cancer that has progressed to metastasis after treatment for what was initially localised or locally advanced disease (referred to as \u2018recurrent mHSPC'), as demonstrated by shorter median OS and time to castration resistance (Francini et al 2018, Francini et al 2019, Gravis et al 2015).  In addition, loss of PTEN gene expression in prostate cancer is associated with features of more aggressive disease and poor prognosis; patients with PTEN loss at diagnosis have increased risk of recurrence and poorer survival (Ahearn et al 2015, Chaux et al 2012, Cuzick et al 2013, Lotan et al 2016, Reid et al 2010).  Thus, there is an important unmet medical need for treatments in the de novo mHSPC setting that are able to delay cancer progression and ultimately, death, particularly in patients whose tumours are characterised by PTEN deficiency. In nonclinical studies, capivasertib inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines that represent both hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant disease settings (Davies et al 2012, Liu and Dong 2014, Marques et al 2015).  Single-agent capivasertib also inhibited the growth of both androgen-dependent and castrate-resistant prostate tumour xenograft models (Thomas et al 2013), genetically engineered prostate tumours (De Velasco et al 2016), and patient-derived xenografts (Marques et al 2015).  Sensitivity to capivasertib correlated with loss of PTEN expression.  Inhibition of tumour growth in prostate tumour models with PI3K pathway inhibitors and specifically with capivasertib alone resulted in upregulation of the AR and AR-mediated gene expression (Carver et al 2011, Mulholland et al 2011, Thomas et al 2013, Marques et al 2015).  Since the AR and PI3K\/AKT pathways cross regulate one another through reciprocal feedback (Carver et al 2011, Mulholland et al 2011), the combined inhibition of AKT and the AR axis in prostate cancer may provide greater benefit than targeting either pathway alone. These nonclinical data for capivasertib are supported by the results of the Phase II randomised ASTON MARTIN study with ipatasertib, an AKT inhibitor with a similar mechanism of action to capivasertib.  The results showed that ipatasertib given in combination with abiraterone prolonged rPFS compared with abiraterone alone in patients with mCRPC and PTEN-deficient tumours.  In the ITT population, median rPFS was 8.2 months for the ipatasertib 400 mg group compared with 6.4 months for placebo: HR, 0.75 (90% CI: 0.54, 1.05).  In the PTEN-deficient group, median rPFS was 11.5 months on ipatasertib 400 mg compared with 4.6 months on placebo: HR, 0.39 (90% CI: 0.22, 0.70) (de Bono et al 2019).  The combination of ipatasertib and abiraterone is under evaluation in mCRPC in an ongoing Phase 3 study (NCT03072238), which is now fully enrolled. A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of capivasertib is provided in the IB. 2.3  Benefit-Risk Assessment 2.3.1  Risk Assessment Based on nonclinical and clinical data available to date, the risks associated with capivasertib are as follows: Identified Risks: nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, dry skin, pruritus, decreased appetite Important Identified Risks: diarrhoea, rash, hyperglycaemia, hypersensitivity Important Potential Risk: QT prolongation Overall, in the monotherapy intermittent dosage pool of patients in previous studies (n = 229), 42.4% of the 229 patients had SAEs, 17% of the 229 had causally related SAEs, and 3.1% were reported with SAEs leading to death.  There were no capivasertib treatment-related deaths in this pool.  A total of 17.5% patients were discontinued due to AEs, and a total of 11.4% were discontinued due to AEs that were considered related to capivasertib treatment. Diarrhoea As of the data cut-off (DCO) date of October 2019, diarrhoea (all grades) has been observed in 79.9% of patients on capivasertib monotherapy (intermittent dosing); most (84%) of these events have been of Grade 2 or lower, managed by dose modifications and supportive care (eg, loperamide), and have only resulted in a 1.3% incidence of drug discontinuation. Hyperglycaemia Hyperglycaemia has been observed with AKT inhibitors.  AKT inhibitor-induced hyperglycaemia is associated with induction of liver glycogenolysis as well as reduction in peripheral glucose uptake.  This effect may be exaggerated by steroid therapy which is co-administered with abiraterone.  Based on currently available data from AstraZeneca-sponsored studies, hyperglycaemia due to capivasertib tends to be transient and reversible on cessation of treatment.  There is a trend of an increase in plasma glucose levels peaking at approximately 4 hours post-dose, generally returning towards baseline levels at 8 hours and beyond.  Dose discontinuations due to AEs of hyperglycaemia were uncommon in previous studies (0.9% of patients).  There were no data to suggest that the transient hyperglycaemia associated with capivasertib treatment had clinically important consequences. Patients with Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes who require insulin treatment, and\/or patients who have glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) \u2265 8.0% (63.9 mmol\/mol) at screening, will be excluded from the study.  Fasting glucose and HbA1c will be monitored throughout the study.  Hyperglycaemia will be mitigated by dose modifications as per toxicity management guidelines, including administration of antidiabetic agents (eg, metformin) when required. Potential Effect on QT Interval Inhibition of the PI3K signalling pathway has been identified as a potential cause of drug-induced long QT syndrome via an inhibition of cardiac potassium currents (IKr, IKs) and an increase of the cardiac late sodium current.  Based on nonclinical data available, QT prolongation has been noted as important potential risk with capivasertib.  QT prolongation has been observed with ADT.  The clinical data available to date do not support any clinically relevant trend of QT prolongation.  Based on a concentration-response modelling analysis, the estimated mean QTcF change from baseline was 4.0 ms (90% CI: 2.9, 5.1 ms) at the therapeutic dose (400 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off) and steady state geometric mean Cmax, which gives an approximate 4- to 5-fold margin to the level of regulatory concern for oncology drugs (20 ms) (Garnett et al 2018).  In AstraZeneca-sponsored clinical studies with capivasertib, there were no reports of sudden death, torsades de pointes, or seizures.  Further details on the risks are available in Section 6 of the IB \u2018Summary of data and guidance for the investigators'.  The study eligibility criteria take into account a potential impact on QT interval.  GnRH analogues\/ADT are known to be associated with QTc prolongation. Ongoing Phase Ib Study D3618C00002 Capivasertib is being evaluated in combination with abiraterone and GnRH analogues in an ongoing Phase Ib study (D3618C00002) in patients with mCRPC.  Following review of the starting dose of capivasertib (400 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off) in combination with standard dose abiraterone (+ prednisone), the study's safety review committee concluded that there were no dose-limiting toxicities observed to preclude further study of the combination at this dose level (see Section 4.3). Externally-Sponsored Research Studies There are 17 externally-sponsored research studies with capivasertib ongoing, completed, or terminated.  Of these 17, 8 are investigating capivasertib specifically and a further 9 are \u201cumbrella\/basket\u201d studies in which capivasertib is an option in a panel of investigational drugs.  Key safety information reported to AstraZeneca by externally-sponsored research sponsors has been incorporated in the IB. 2.3.2  Benefit Assessment Hormonal therapy targeting the androgen axis remains the mainstay of initial treatment for mHSPC and typically gives rapid disease response and control; however, resistance to hormonal therapies inevitably occurs with time and the cancer starts to progress. PTEN-deficient prostate cancer is associated with higher Gleason score, tumour stage, and poorer prognosis.  The AR and PI3K\/AKT signalling networks cross regulate each other, and the combination of capivasertib with an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor is anticipated to enhance efficacy in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer.  Clinical and nonclinical data with capivasertib support the hypothesis that AKT inhibition may be a valid treatment strategy for mHSPC.  Capivasertib has demonstrated clinical activity in several settings including patients with advanced AKT1 mutant solid tumours as monotherapy or in combination with other agents.  The experimental agent ipatasertib has the same mode of action, and in a randomised Phase II study (ASTON MARTIN) in patients with CRPC, demonstrated meaningful improvement in rPFS when added to abiraterone and ADT (de Bono et al 2019). 2.3.3  Overall Benefit-Risk Conclusion The emerging safety profile of capivasertib from nonclinical and early clinical studies has not identified risks that would preclude investigation in this setting.  The study design aims to minimise potential risks in several ways.  First, the protocol includes safety monitoring in excess of standard of care monitoring, with the intent of protecting participants involved in the study.  Furthermore, investigators will be provided with a safety management strategy for the management of key toxicities, and monitoring is in place for those risks deemed to be most likely or serious.  Thus, based upon the clinical and nonclinical safety profile of capivasertib, the limited life expectancy due to malignant disease, and the strength of the scientific hypothesis under evaluation, the benefit-risk assessment for this study supports treatment with capivasertib given in addition to standard androgen suppression therapy in the form of abiraterone and LHRH analogue\/surgical castration in patients with mHSPC. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected AEs of capivasertib may be found in the IB. 3  OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS Table 3  Objectives and Endpoints Objectives  Objectives Endpoints  Endpoints Primary  Primary   None \u2022  To compare the effect of capivasertib + abiraterone relative to placebo + abiraterone by assessment of radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in patients with PTEN-deficient mHSPC.  \u2022  To compare the effect of capivasertib + abiraterone relative to placebo + abiraterone by assessment of radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in patients with PTEN-deficient mHSPC. \u2022  rPFS is defined as the time from randomisation to: 1) radiographic progression, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), or 2) death due to any cause.  \u2022  rPFS is defined as the time from randomisation to: 1) radiographic progression, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), or 2) death due to any cause.

Participants will be recruited globally from approximately 30 countries and approximately 350 study sites in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and Asia (including China and Japan). Approximately 5500 participants will be enrolled and screened to achieve a total of 1000 randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 treatment arms.  For regulatory submission purposes in China, the study will include approximately 150 randomised participants from sites in mainland China and those from Taiwan and Hong Kong accredited by the National Medical Product Administration (NMPA). Screening will be conducted in a 2-part process (see Figure 2), which must be completed within a 3-month period between the participant starting ADT and being randomised to study treatment.  In the 3-month period between screening Part 1 and randomisation, participants may be receiving abiraterone as well as ADT.  Part 1 will include those eligibility criteria marked with an asterisk (*) in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, and testing for PTEN status.  In Part 2, all remaining screening assessments will be performed, and must be completed within 28 days before randomisation.  The assessments to be performed at screening are shown in the SoA (Table 1)."

          "Text":"Figure 2  Two-part Screening Process None Table 1 shows the assessments to be completed in screening Parts 1 and 2. Eligible participants will have histologically confirmed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma, without small-cell features.  PTEN status is confirmed by IHC via central testing of tumour tissue using an Investigational Use Only (IUO) assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, USA).  For screening Part 1, patients are required to provide a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour sample, collected as part of routine clinical practice, for central testing.  This should preferably be a tissue block that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides, or if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides from the same block.  In addition, for screening Part 1 an optional tumour sample (FFPE block [preferred] or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections) can be provided.  These slides will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/or diagnostic test development.  Participants who provide this optional sample in Part 1 do not need to provide additional tumour sample for screening Part 2.  For screening Part 2, eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) will be required to provide an additional tumour sample FFPE block (preferred) or 20 (minimum 15) freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  This sample will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and\/or diagnostic test development.  Further details on tissue specifications are outlined in the Laboratory Manual and the Pathology Testing Manual as well as in Section 8.6.1.  A patient cannot be randomised until a valid, central laboratory tested PTEN IHC result indicates PTEN deficiency.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1; no additional slides will be collected for screening Part 2. Blood samples for analysis of ctDNA and other circulating biomarkers will also be collected and analysed (not applicable for China patients). Approximately 1000 participants will be randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive either capivasertib or placebo, in combination with abiraterone on a background of ADT.  It is expected that approximately 5500 potential participants will be screened.  The screen failure rate is estimated on the following assumptions: PTEN deficiency prevalence of 21% (screen failure rate of 79%), as well as a further 15% screen failure for other reasons (eg, informed consent\/ eligibility criteria\/PTEN IHC test failure rate).  Participants will receive oral treatment with capivasertib or placebo BD (4 days on and 3 days off) until progression or discontinuation.  Participants will also receive the approved oral dose of abiraterone (1000 mg once daily) with 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone daily.  All participants should also receive continuous ADT using either a LHRH agonist, a LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy. The randomisation scheme will be stratified on the following factors: Combination of volume of disease according to CHAARTED criteria and presence of visceral metastases (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease) Geographic location: North America, Western Europe, and Australia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and Asia. High volume disease is defined as the presence of either visceral metastases (or \u2265 4 bone metastases with \u2265 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis (Sweeney et al 2015).  For the purposes of this study, visceral metastases are defined by the list provided within the IWRS. An IDMC will assess the progress of the study at regular intervals.  This will include reviewing unblinded safety and tolerability data and the data from the interim efficacy analysis to provide a recommendation to AstraZeneca as to whether the study should continue unchanged, be stopped, or be modified in any way. Section 6.7 describes treatment intervention after the end of the study. 4.2  Scientific Rationale for Study Design Choice of Background Therapy At the time of initiation of this study, the Category 1 recommended treatment options for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer in the US include ADT in combination with docetaxel, abiraterone (+ prednisone), apalutamide, or enzalutamide, since these combinations have all reported OS improvement over ADT alone in randomised Phase III studies in this setting (NCCN 2019).  Alternatives include ADT with addition of radiation therapy (for low volume mHSPC) or ADT with abiraterone with methylprednisolone (Category 2B).  The European Association of Urology (EAU) treatment guidelines currently recommend a choice between abiraterone and chemotherapy as systemic treatment in addition to a background of ADT, irrespective of risk status (EAU guidelines 2019).  In patients with previously untreated mHSPC, docetaxel or abiraterone treatment resulted in an OS of 57.6 and 53.3 months respectively, and patients progress to mCRPC on average 33 months after start of treatment Fizazi et al 2017, Sweeney et al 2015).  Since mHSPC patients inevitably progress to a castration-resistant phenotype, therapeutic interventions that are able to delay the time to disease progression would address an important unmet medical need.  Although currently incurable, the disease is more amenable to intervention and a targeted treatment approach may bring additional benefits over AR-based treatments alone (Fizazi et al 2017). There is an increasing focus on the development of molecularly-targeted agents for individualised treatment in prostate cancer, eg, PARP inhibitors in patients with DNA repair pathway alteration (Mateo et al 2015, Mateo et al 2019, Hussain et al 2019).  Activation of the PI3K\/AKT\/mTOR pathway is common in prostate cancer, predominantly due to PTEN loss (Robinson et al 2015, Abida et al 2017), and there is a reciprocal relationship between this pathway and the AR pathway, such that inhibition of one leads to upregulation of the other (Carver et al 2011).  Of note, PTEN loss has been shown to be an indicator of poor prognosis in prostate cancer; PTEN loss was associated with early biochemical recurrence, extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle involvement, and poorer cause-specific and overall survival, based on samples predominantly from patients with localised or locally advanced prostate cancer (Krohn et al 2012, Reid et al 2010, Troyer et al 2015). Evidence from clinical studies is emerging for the benefits of AKT inhibition in combination with abiraterone in the treatment of prostate cancer; eg, the Phase II ASTON MARTIN study of ipatasertib in combination with abiraterone in patients with mCRPC prolonged rPFS compared with abiraterone alone, especially in patients with PTEN-deficient tumours: median rPFS was 11.5 versus 4.6 months (de Bono et al 2019).  Since the proof of concept for AKT inhibition in a metastatic prostate cancer setting was obtained for ipatasertib in combination with abiraterone, enrolment into the present study is restricted to patients for whom abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) plus ADT is considered the optimal treatment approach by the treating investigator; patients requiring another treatment modality such as docetaxel or radiotherapy are not eligible. In summary, although abiraterone is an approved therapy and is a recommended treatment option for patients with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC in current evidence-based guidelines, there is still a significant unmet medical need in this population.  In particular, patients with PTEN-deficient tumours may experience improved treatment outcomes from the addition of a molecularly targeted agent, including those that specifically inhibit the PI3K\/AKT pathway.  Therefore, addition of the AKT inhibitor capivasertib to standard abiraterone therapy could improve treatment outcomes in mHSPC patients with PTEN-deficient tumours and delay the development of castration resistance. Abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA\u00ae) is converted in vivo to abiraterone, an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor.  Specifically, abiraterone selectively inhibits the enzyme 17\u03b1 hydroxylase\/C17,20 lyase (CYP17).  This enzyme is expressed in, and is required for, androgen biosynthesis in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic tumour tissues.  CYP17 catalyses the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone into testosterone precursors, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione, respectively, by 17\u03b1-hydroxylation and cleavage of the C17,20 bond.  CYP17 inhibition also results in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals.  Abiraterone was first approved (in combination with prednisone) for the treatment of mCRPC.  The indication has since been extended to include the treatment of newly diagnosed high-risk mHSPC (ZYTIGA Prescribing Information 2019, Zytiga SmPC 2019). The approval of abiraterone in mHSPC was supported by 2 large randomised controlled studies demonstrating the survival and other patient-relevant benefits of abiraterone given in addition to ADT: STAMPEDE (Arm G) (James et al 2017) and LATITUDE (Fizazi et al 2017, Fizazi et al 2019).  The LATITUDE study (unlike STAMPEDE) required all participants to have high-risk mHSPC, defined by having at least 2 of the following: Gleason score of \u2265 8, \u2265 3 bone metastases, or the presence of visceral metastases.  The reduction in the risk of death was nearly identical between the two studies, with a HR of 0.62, also confirmed in a meta-analysis.  Furthermore, post hoc analyses of STAMPEDE demonstrated that abiraterone achieved positive outcomes in men with mHSPC (including rPFS and OS) regardless of low or high burden of disease.  The definition of \u2018low volume' versus \u2018high volume' disease was based on the CHAARTED criteria (presence of either visceral metastases or > 3 bone metastases).  Risk status (\u2018low risk' vs \u2018high risk') was defined using the LATITUDE criteria (Hoyle et al 2019; Sweeney et al 2015, Fizazi et al 2017).  In addition to the effects on failure-free survival and OS in STAMPEDE, significant benefits of add-on abiraterone were also seen for PROs in LATITUDE, including progression of pain, prostate cancer symptoms, fatigue, functional decline, and overall HRQoL (Chi et al 2018). Based on the studies and clinical practice guidelines discussed above, abiraterone (+ prednisone\/prednisolone) plus ADT combination therapy currently is a recommended standard-of-care first-line option for the treatment of men with de novo mHSPC, irrespective of risk status or disease volume (EAU guidelines 2019, Mottet et al 2018, NCCN 2019, Parker et al 2015, Parker et al 2017). Study Population The study population is associated with considerable unmet medical need, as described in Section 2.2. The rationale for the inclusion of participants with mHSPC without high-risk features in this study is based on the analyses from the STAMPEDE study, which demonstrated that abiraterone achieved positive efficacy outcomes for both rPFS and OS in the target patient population, regardless of risk status (James et al 2017).  In addition, as noted above, classifying patients with prostate cancer for treatment based on risk status is not distinguished within treatment guidelines, and is not routinely done in the clinic. Only adenocarcinomas without small-cell histology are allowed; this is consistent with the LATITUDE study (Fizazi et al 2017), which was the primary basis for the approval of abiraterone in mHSPC. The presence of metastatic disease will be confirmed using standard imaging techniques that are widely used in the staging of prostate cancer in routine clinical practice, with RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 principles adopted for assessment of metastatic lesions. Only patients with ECOG performance status 0 or 1 are eligible, in line with guidelines recommending that abiraterone should be offered only to patients with ECOG status 0 or 1. The use of mild opioid analgesics for cancer-related pain, bisphosphonates and denosumab for management of bone-related metastases, LHRH analogues (ie, ADT) to maintain testosterone < 50 ng\/dL, conventional multivitamins and selenium, prednisone dose increases and eplerenone to manage refractory mineralocorticoid-related toxicities, transfusions and haematopoietic growth factors will all be permitted during the study.  However, where possible, these will be kept at a stable dose to allow accurate characterisation of the capivasertib treatment effect. Stratification Factors The randomisation scheme will be stratified based a combination of volume of disease and presence of visceral metastases, and also geographic location (as described in Section 4.1). Volume of disease as determined by the CHAARTED criteria is considered a key prognostic factor in prostate cancer.  High volume disease is defined as the presence of visceral metastases or \u2265 4 bone lesions with \u2265 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis.  Although abiraterone has been shown to provide benefit to patients with mHSPC in each risk status and volume subgroup, the overall prognosis as measured by median failure-free survival, PFS, and OS was markedly shorter in patients with high disease volume (Hoyle et al 2019).  This prognostic effect is further supported by analyses of other agents in mHSPC (Sweeney et al 2015, Stenzl et al 2019). Presence of visceral metastases is a known prognostic factor in prostate cancer and was incorporated into both the LATITUDE risk and CHAARTED disease volume criteria.  However, visceral tumour sites (eg, lung and liver metastases) were shown to be independently related to worse prognosis in a meta-analysis of 8802 men with prostate cancer (Halabi at al 2016).  The combination of volume of disease (high versus low) according to CHAARTED criteria and presence of visceral metastases results in a stratification factor with 3 levels (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease), as according to the definition, patients with low disease volume would not have visceral metastases.  For the purposes of this study, visceral metastases are defined by the list provided within the IWRS. The geographic split of Western Europe, Australia plus United States, Latin America plus Eastern Europe, and Asia was chosen to account for possible differences in PSA screening, and healthcare accessibility and quality in different regions that could affect both the primary treatment outcome and post study (eg, OS) endpoints. Study Endpoints The definition of rPFS (see Section 8.1.2.1) is considered to be consistent with EMA guidance in the prostate cancer-specific appendix to the Guideline on the Evaluation of Anticancer Medicinal Products in Man (EMA 2015) which recognises PFS as an acceptable primary endpoint.  PFS is also listed in the FDA's table of surrogate endpoints and has supported prior approvals in prostate cancer (FDA 2019).  Reducing the risk of radiographic progression is of clinical importance given the strong positive correlation reported for PFS and OS in patients with mCRPC.  Also, a recent study of enzalutamide in patients with mHSPC (ARCHES; Armstrong et al 2019) which was the basis of the recent FDA approval and positive opinion adopted by the CHMP for this indication, utilised rPFS as the primary endpoint.  The Phase III study supporting the FDA approval of apalutamide used rPFS as a dual primary endpoint (with OS) (Chi et al 2019). The median OS for the mHSPC patient population treated with ADT and abiraterone is over 5 years.  It is considered that an unfeasibly large and long study (more than 4000 patients and a study duration of over 11 years) would be required to obtain sufficient statistical power to detect OS differences in a reasonable timeframe.  However, the study population will be followed up after the primary analysis for rPFS for longer term endpoints, including OS. The key secondary efficacy endpoints for this study have been widely adopted in clinical studies in patients with prostate cancer and overall, are considered to represent the most clinically meaningful events for patients.  Prostate cancer typically metastasises to bone and is associated with risk of pathological fractures, spinal cord compression and severe pain with detrimental impact on quality of life.  Reducing the risk of developing symptomatic skeletal-related events and delaying the onset of pain are considered highly clinically relevant endpoints in the context of prostate cancer. The study includes several PRO endpoints, of which AstraZeneca considers the measurement of pain as the most relevant measure of the patient experience with mHSPC, and will be an alpha-controlled secondary endpoint, defined based on the BPI-SF worst pain (Item 3) and analgesic use.  Additionally, a comprehensive evaluation of fatigue, symptoms, impacts, treatment tolerability, and HRQoL will provide a totality of PRO evidence. 4.3  Justification for Dose Several doses and schedules have been investigated for capivasertib.  In the capivasertib clinical programme as of 04 October 2019 (the DCO for the current IB), approximately 1150 patients had been exposed to capivasertib as monotherapy or in combination with other agents: approximately 480 patients in AstraZeneca-sponsored studies and 672 in Investigator-sponsored studies.  More detailed information may be found in the IB. The recommended regimen for monotherapy (480 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off) was selected based on pharmacodynamic parameters from tumour biopsies, PK data, and clinical safety.  The recommended regimen of capivasertib with paclitaxel or with fulvestrant is 400 mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off. Clinical studies with the AKT inhibitor ipatasertib have demonstrated efficacy and favourable tolerability in different tumour types at the same dose (400 mg QD continuously), namely in TNBC with the paclitaxel combination (LOTUS study; Kim et al 2017) and in prostate cancer with the abiraterone combination (ASTON MARTIN Phase II study; de Bono et al 2019). Therefore, the capivasertib dose regimen (400 mg BD, 4 days on, 3 days off), which has demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in randomised Phase II studies in metastatic TNBC (PAKT; Schmid et al 2020) and HR+ advanced breast cancer (FAKTION; Jones et al 2019), is hypothesised to be effective and tolerable also in prostate cancer. Since no major influence of gender or age has been observed on the PK of capivasertib and the risk of PK interactions between capivasertib and abiraterone + prednisone\/prednisolone in combination with GnRH analogues is low, similar systemic exposure is expected in the prostate cancer population as in the breast cancer populations. The conversion of abiraterone acetate to its active metabolite abiraterone is likely through esterase activity and is not CYP-mediated.  Abiraterone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and capivasertib is a direct and time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  However, co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of abiraterone.  Abiraterone has the potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C8, and to a lesser extent CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4\/5.  Capivasertib is primarily metabolised by UGT2B7 and CYP3A4.  In vitro, abiraterone and its major metabolites were shown to inhibit the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1.  There are no clinical data available to confirm transporter-based interactions. Clinically relevant interactions between capivasertib and prednisone\/prednisolone are unlikely.  Drugs which inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, indinavir, macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin) have the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of corticosteroids.  The strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%.  However, capivasertib is not a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 based on in vitro results and PBPK simulations.  Glucocorticoids are moderate inducers of CYP3A4, but capivasertib is unlikely to be a sensitive substrate of CYP3A4.  The risk for drug-drug interactions between capivasertib and GnRH analogues is low.  These drugs are peptides, metabolised by peptidases, so it is unlikely that they would be affected by CYP450 inhibitors. The ongoing Phase Ib Study D3618C00002 in patients with mCRPC is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and PK of capivasertib in combination with abiraterone (+ prednisone\/ prednisolone) and GnRH analogues.  After review of the first dose level (400 mg BD, 4 days on, 3 days off) in combination with standard dose abiraterone + prednisone in n=8 patients with heavily pretreated mCPRC, the safety review committee concluded that there were no dose-limiting toxicities observed to preclude further study of the combination at this dose level.  The capivasertib PK was as predicted from previous studies where capivasertib was given as monotherapy.  Thus, the capivasertib dosing regimen of 400 mg BD, 4 days on, 3 days off, is selected for the present study in combination with abiraterone and ADT.  This regimen is also being examined in the Phase 3 breast cancer programme (CAPItello-290\/D3614C00001 and CAPItello-291\/D3615C00001, in combination with paclitaxel or with fulvestrant, respectively). Guidelines for modification of the capivasertib\/placebo dose in the present study are provided in Section 6.6. 4.4  End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study when they have completed all phases of the study including their last scheduled visit or their last scheduled procedure in the SoA (Table 2). The end of the study is defined as the date of last expected visit\/contact of the last participant undergoing the study. 5  STUDY POPULATION Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrolment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted. Following written informed consent, all participants will undergo central PTEN status assessment using the IHC assay (see Section 6.1.2) and initial eligibility criteria review, as defined by the marked criteria (*) in Section 5.1 (inclusion criteria) and Section 5.2 (exclusion criteria), below. 5.1  Inclusion Criteria Participants are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria apply: Age 1  *Participant must be \u2265 18 years of age (\u2265 20 years of age in Japan), at the time of signing the informed consent. Type of Participant and Disease Characteristics *Histologically-confirmed de novo (ie, diagnosed within 3 months of randomisation) metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma.  Note: adenocarcinoma must be the primary histological pattern and patients with small-cell tumours are not eligible. *Consent to provide a FFPE tissue block (preferred) or slides.  Details on tissue requirements are specified in the Laboratory Manual.  Cytologic or FNA samples are not acceptable.  Tumour tissue from bone metastases is not acceptable. *A valid PTEN IHC result indicating PTEN deficiency (centralised testing). Metastatic disease documented prior to randomisation by clear evidence of \u2265 1 bone lesion (defined as 1 lesion with positive uptake on bone scan) and\/or \u2265 1 soft tissue lesion (measurable and\/or non-measurable) that can be accurately assessed at baseline and is suitable for repeated assessment with CT and\/or MRI.  Patients with metastatic disease identified by PSMA PET only, will not be eligible.  Local lymph node involvement is not considered metastatic disease. Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic form of prostate cancer based on the investigator's clinical evaluation. *Candidate for abiraterone and steroid therapy.  Previous treatment with abiraterone and\/or a steroid for de novo disease is allowed up to a maximum of 3 months prior to randomisation (prior treatment with chemotherapy or other NHAs is not allowed). Ongoing ADT with GnRH analogue (combination with first generation androgen receptor antagonists, eg, bicalutamide is allowed), or LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy.  Duration of ongoing ADT (regardless of method) is from 0 days to a maximum of 3 months prior to randomisation. ECOG\/WHO performance status 0 to 1 (see Appendix A) with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks. *Able and willing to swallow and retain oral medication. Participants must complete the 7-day BPI-SF and BFI questionnaires and the analgesic diary during screening (only after PTEN deficiency is confirmed), prior to randomisation.  Note: it is required to give participants at least 7 consecutive days to complete the assessments prior to randomisation.  If a minimum of 4 assessments is not completed during the 7-day period, participants must be re-screened, a new 7 days of questionnaire\/diary entries completed, and any screening tests which are consequently outside of the applicable 28 days prior to randomisation must also be repeated.  Sex *Participants will be male. Reproduction 13  Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm: Sterilisation (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). Participants should use barrier contraception (ie, condoms) from the time of screening until 16 weeks after discontinuation of study drug.  It is not known whether the pre-clinical changes seen in the male animal reproductive organs, after treatment with capivasertib, will be fully reversible or will permanently affect the ability to produce healthy sperm following treatment.  Therefore, if participants wish to father children, they should be advised to arrange for collection of sperm samples prior to the start of study treatment. Informed Consent *Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix B 3, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICF and in this CSP. Provision of signed and dated written Optional Genetic Research Information informed consent prior to collection of samples for optional genetic research that supports Genomic Initiative. 5.2  Exclusion Criteria Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply: Medical Conditions Radiotherapy with a wide field of radiation (eg, more than one-third of the skeleton) within 4 weeks before the start of study treatment (capivasertib\/placebo). Major surgery (excluding placement of vascular access, transurethral resection of prostate, bilateral orchiectomy, or internal stents) within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment.

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 2.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) if no demonstrable liver metastases or > 5x ULN in the presence of liver metastases.  Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is not exclusionary if due to the presence of bone metastases and liver function is otherwise considered adequate in the investigator's judgement. Total bilirubin > 1.5x ULN (participants with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome may be included in the study with a higher value) Creatinine > 1.5x ULN concurrent with creatinine clearance < 50 mL\/min (measured or calculated by Cockcroft and Gault equation); confirmation of creatinine clearance is only required when creatinine is > 1.5x ULN. *As judged by the investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including active bleeding diatheses, or known active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV.

The clinical relevance of this is unknown, but until further information is available a conservative approach has been taken to recommend that participants fast from at least 2 hours before dosing to at least 1 hour after dosing, where possible.  Water can be allowed as desired. In addition, participants should avoid herbal supplements (eg, St John's wort) and ingestion of large amounts of foods and beverages known to potently modulate CYP3A4 enzyme activity, during study treatment.  For example, no more than half a grapefruit, a small glass of grapefruit juice or 2 teaspoons of Seville orange marmalade should be consumed daily.  Please refer to Appendix C for further guidance. Participants will be required to fast from at least 2 hours before until at least 1 hour after each dose of abiraterone, due to an effect of food on absorption.  Water can be allowed as desired. 5.3.2  Caffeine, Alcohol, and Tobacco No interactions with caffeine, alcohol or tobacco have been identified. 5.3.3  Contraception Participants must use a condom during treatment and for 16 weeks after the last dose of capivasertib when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing potential.  Female partners of male participants should also use a highly effective form of contraception (as described in Appendix D) if they are of childbearing potential.  Participants should not donate sperm throughout the period of taking capivasertib and for 3 months following the last dose of capivasertib. 5.3.4  Other Restrictions Participants who are blood donors should not donate blood during the study and for 3 months following their last dose of study treatment.  For blood donation after study participation, refer to WHO guidelines (WHO 2012). 5.4  Screen Failures Screen failures are defined as patients who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently randomised.  A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities.  Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any SAE.  If a patient is ineligible and not randomised, the IWRS should be contacted to terminate the participant in the system (screen failed). Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may be rescreened once (per screening part), upon the Study Physician's approval and agreement.  However, rescreening should be documented so that its effect on study results, if any, can be assessed.  These participants should have the reason for study withdrawal, including failed inclusion\/exclusion criteria, recorded in the eCRF.  Rescreened participants should be assigned the same participant number as for the initial screening. 6  STUDY INTERVENTION Study intervention is defined as any investigational intervention(s), marketed product(s), placebo, or medical device(s) intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study protocol.  Study intervention in this study refers to capivasertib or placebo, and abiraterone, administered from the date of randomisation. Abiraterone is indicated for use in combination with ADT, and it is also recommended that abiraterone is used with prednisone or prednisolone; for details see Section 6.5.1.  In this study, ADT, prednisone, and prednisolone are NIMPs\/background therapy, and these should be prescribed in accordance with local guidelines, where applicable. 6.1  Study Intervention(s) Administered 6.1.1  Investigational Products Details of the Investigational Products are provided in Table 4.

Where possible, all doses of capivasertib\/placebo should be taken at approximately the same time each day, 12 hours apart in a fasted state (water to drink only) from at least 2 hours prior to the dose to at least 1 hour post-dose.  Additional fasting restrictions apply on days where fasting glucose is to be tested (Section 8.2.4.1).  If vomiting occurs, a replacement dose should not be taken, and the participant should take their allotted dose at the next scheduled time. Should a participant miss a scheduled dose, the participant will be allowed to take the dose up to a maximum of 2 hours after the scheduled dose time, with a fasting state being maintained.  If greater than 2 hours after the scheduled dose time, the missed dose should not be taken, and the participant should take their allotted dose at the next scheduled time.  If a participant needs to take the dose earlier, the participant can take the dose up to 2 hours earlier than the scheduled dose time.  The participant should make every reasonable effort to take the capivasertib\/placebo tablet(s) on time. Any regular medication required by the participant can be taken at the same time as capivasertib\/placebo in a fasted state (as described above), provided that this does not contravene the dosing instructions in the prescribing information for that medication. Abiraterone should be taken under fasting conditions (only water to drink) from at least 2 hours prior to dosing to at least 1 hour post-dose.  The tablets should be swallowed whole with water and not crushed or chewed. 6.1.2  Medical Devices Documented PTEN deficiency of tumour tissue is required for selection of participants onto the study.  All participants must provide FFPE tumour tissue (block or slides) from primary or metastatic sites (excluding bone metastases or FNA samples) for IHC-based determination of PTEN deficiency.  Ventana Medical Systems (Tucson, USA) will provide the Investigational Use Only (IUO) assay for centralised PTEN IHC testing.  This assay is being developed for approval as a companion diagnostic for capivasertib. 6.2  Preparation\/Handling\/Storage\/Accountability of Interventions The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study intervention received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study intervention. Only participants randomised in the study may receive study intervention and only authorised site staff may supply or administer study intervention.  All study intervention must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labelled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorised site staff. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). Any study drug remaining at the end of the study must be destroyed or returned according to the sites local standard operating procedures following authorisation by the sponsor. 6.3  Measures to Minimise Bias: Randomisation and Blinding Eligible participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio (capivasertib + abiraterone: placebo + abiraterone) by a permuted block randomisation approach stratified on the following factors: Combination of volume of disease according to CHAARTED criteria and presence of visceral metastases (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases\/high volume disease without visceral metastases\/low volume disease) Geographic location (North America, Western Europe, and Australia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and Asia). Capivasertib and placebo tablets will be identical and presented in the same packaging to ensure blinding of the capivasertib.  Capivasertib and placebo will be labelled using a unique kit identification (kit ID) number, which is linked to the randomisation scheme. All participants will be centrally assigned to randomised study treatment using an IWRS.  Before the study is initiated, the log-in information and directions for the IWRS will be provided to each study site. Abiraterone will be allocated to be dispensed to each participant using the IWRS system (if centrally sourced) or via the local pharmacy (if locally sourced) at each participant dispensing visit.  Routines for this will be described in the IWRS user manual that will be provided to each centre. Each patient will obtain a unique randomisation number via the IWRS. The actual treatment given to individual participants will be determined by a randomisation scheme that will be loaded into the IWRS database.  The randomisation scheme will be produced by a computer software program called AZRand (AZ Global Randomisation system) that incorporates a standard procedure for generating random numbers. A blocked randomisation will be generated, and all centres will use the same list in order to minimise any imbalance in the number of participants assigned to each treatment group. Eligibility will be established before treatment randomisation.  It is recommended that participants commence study treatment as soon as possible after randomisation and ideally on the same day of randomisation. If a participant withdraws from the study, then his enrolment\/randomisation code cannot be reused.  Withdrawn participants will not be replaced. The IWRS will be programmed with blind-breaking instructions.  In case of an emergency, in which the knowledge of the specific blinded study treatment will affect the immediate management of the participant's condition (eg, antidote available), the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participants' intervention assignment is warranted.  Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination.  If a participant's intervention assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind.  The investigator must document and report the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing to AstraZeneca staff the treatment that was given to the participant. AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an IMP and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities.  Randomisation codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual participant have been made and documented. 6.4  Study Intervention Compliance Data regarding capivasertib\/placebo dosing will be collected during the scheduled site visits and entered into the eCRF along with reasons for missed dose(s) if applicable. In addition, participants will be required to return all bottles of study medication at the start of the next cycle.  The number of tablets remaining will be counted by the research nurse\/ pharmacist\/investigator, documented in the eCRF and returned to pharmacy.  Site personnel are responsible for managing the IMP from receipt by the study site until the destruction or return of all unused IMP. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the participant has returned all unused IMP. 6.5  Concomitant Therapy Any medication or vaccine, including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and\/or herbal supplements, that the participant is receiving at the time of enrolment or receives during the study must be recorded along with: Reason for use Dates of administration including start and end dates Dosage information including dose and frequency This includes details relating to the ADT and prednisone\/prednisolone administered as standard background treatment with the abiraterone. Guidance regarding potential interactions of capivasertib with concomitant medications is provided in Appendix C. 6.5.1  Recommended Concomitant Therapy The following therapies are recommended during study participation, as applicable: Corticosteroids: In the treatment of patients with mHSPC, abiraterone is indicated for use with corticosteroid in the form of 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone daily in line with the locally approved abiraterone package insert.  An increased dose of the corticosteroid may be indicated during and after a stressful situation.  Participants will receive the treating investigator's choice of commercially available prednisone or prednisolone. Androgen deprivation therapy: Abiraterone is indicated for use in combination with ADT; therefore, participants must be receiving the treating investigator's choice of commercially available LHRH analogues or have received surgical castration. Anti-diarrhoeal therapy for symptomatic treatment of diarrhoea, as indicated in the toxicity management guideline (see Section 8.3.12.3). Antidiabetic therapy for management of hyperglycaemia (see Section 8.3.12.3). Concomitant medication may be given as medically indicated.  Details (including doses, frequency, route, and start and stop dates) of the concomitant medication given must be recorded in the participant's medical records and in the eCRF. 6.5.2  Restricted Concomitant Therapy The following concomitant therapies are restricted during study treatment: Other anticancer agents, other investigational agents and radiotherapy, although radiation for palliation at focal sites is permitted (as long as the radiation field covers less than 30% of the marrow and does not include whole pelvis or spine; disease progression in the bones has to be excluded by appropriate imaging investigations). Drugs or herbal supplements that are known to be potent inhibitors\/inducers of CYP3A4, as they may increase\/decrease the exposure and thus, affect the toxicity\/efficacy of capivasertib. Drugs known to be sensitive to inhibition of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and\/or CYP2D6 metabolism and\/or MATE1 or OCT2 transport, and which have a narrow therapeutic window; see Appendix C for details.  If co-administration is necessary, then additional monitoring for signs of toxicity related to increased exposure to the substrates is required. The concomitant administration of drugs known to prolong the QT interval is restricted unless considered essential due to participant management, in which case, participants should be closely monitored.  Information regarding drugs known to prolong the QT interval can be found at URL: https:\/\/crediblemeds.org. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers and CYP2D6 substrates with abiraterone; for more details on restrictions and cautions required when administering concomitant medications with abiraterone, please refer to abiraterone local prescribing information. Patients are not eligible to enter the study if they have received any of the medications specified in the exclusion criteria or are unable to observe the cautions and restrictions for restricted therapies (for details please compare Section 5.2 and Appendix C). 6.5.3  Other Concomitant Treatment Supportive care, and other medication, other than that described in Section 6.5.2, considered necessary for the participant's safety and well-being, may be given at the discretion of the investigator and recorded in the appropriate sections of the eCRF. 6.6  Dose Modification 6.6.1  Dose Modification for Capivasertib Dose reductions or holds are allowed as clinically indicated by the treating physician and in line with Table 5.  For each participant, a maximum of 2 dose reductions will be allowed for capivasertib\/placebo.  Dose re-escalations are not allowed for either capivasertib\/placebo. Dose reductions for capivasertib\/placebo should be carried out as described in Table 5.  The dose of capivasertib\/placebo can be reduced twice (initially, reduction to dose reduction level 1; subsequently, in case of occurrence of further \u2265 grade 3 toxicity, further reduction to dose reduction level 2).  For guidance on dose reductions for management of capivasertib related AEs, refer to Section 8.3.12. Table 5  Dose Levels for Capivasertib\/Placebo Study Treatment  Study Treatment Starting Dose  Starting Dose Dose Reduction Levels  Dose Reduction Levels Capivasertib\/placebo  Capivasertib\/placebo 400 mg twice daily  400 mg twice daily Reduction level 1: 320 mg twice daily  Reduction level 1: 320 mg twice daily Reduction level 2: 200 mg twice daily  Reduction level 2: 200 mg twice daily Study Treatment Starting Dose Dose Reduction Levels Capivasertib\/placebo 400 mg twice daily Reduction level 1: 320 mg twice daily Reduction level 2: 200 mg twice daily In the event of an AE which the investigator considers to be related to the administration of study treatment, supportive therapy should be given at the discretion of the investigator.  In addition, the investigator may decide that dosing of study treatment should be temporarily interrupted, a subsequent treatment cycle delayed, or study treatment permanently discontinued as per the guidelines outlined in Section 7.1. Substantial acute toxicities should be managed as medically indicated and with temporary suspension of study drug, as appropriate. A maximum break of 4 consecutive weeks is allowed within each treatment cycle or between 2 consecutive cycles.  Following a treatment break the participant can resume treatment at the Day in the cycle that they stopped.  If the treatment break is longer than the maximum of 4 consecutive weeks, the investigator will need permission from the sponsor Study Physician to allow the participant to restart study treatment. 6.6.2  Dose Modification for Abiraterone In case dose reductions are necessary for abiraterone, the investigator should refer to abiraterone local prescribing information for further details.  These dose reductions should be documented in the eCRF. 6.7  Intervention after the End of the Study After the clinical study database closes, participants who continue to derive clinical benefit from study treatments in the opinion of the investigator may continue to receive study treatment until progression.  These treatments will continue to be provided by AstraZeneca until the availability of either a local commercial supplier and reimbursement programme or an early access programme; at which point a change in supply will be requested.  Treatment of participants beyond progression is not allowed. Please refer to Section 4.4 for End of Study definition. 7  DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION\/WITHDRAWAL 7.1  Discontinuation of Study Intervention Participants may be discontinued from study treatment (ie, capivasertib\/placebo or abiraterone) in the following situations.  Note that discontinuation from study treatment is NOT the same as a complete withdrawal from the study. Participants who discontinue either capivasertib\/placebo or abiraterone should continue to undergo assessments as outlined in the SoA (Table 2).  Participants who discontinue both capivasertib\/placebo and abiraterone should continue the efficacy assessments until disease progression and survival follow-up as outlined in the SoA (Table 2). Radiographic progressive disease is confirmed by the investigator (RECIST 1.1 or PCWG3 bone progression criteria). Clinical disease progression\/worsening of disease under investigation. Participants incorrectly initiated on IMP. Intercurrent illness that, in the judgment of the investigator, will affect assessments of clinical status to a significant degree or contraindicate further dosing. Unacceptable toxicity. Determination by the investigator that it is no longer safe for the participant or in the participant's best interest to continue therapy. Participant request. Severe non-compliance with CSP in the judgement of the investigator and\/or the sponsor.  All protocol deviations must be reported. Clinical need for concomitant or ancillary therapy (ie, non-protocol-specified anticancer therapy) that is not permitted in the study. General or specific changes in the participant's condition that are unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. Participants found to be deriving benefit from treatment and tolerating treatment may continue therapy, subject to agreement between the treating and sponsor physicians.  The participants will be followed according to protocol-defined procedures and assessments.  All protocol deviations will be reviewed, and important protocol deviations will be identified prior to the unblinding of the study. See the SoA (Table 2) for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. All reasons for discontinuation of study treatment must be documented in the eCRF (see Section 7.1.2). 7.1.1  Study Treatment Interruptions If study treatment will be interrupted for a period longer than allowed in the dose modification guidelines (Section 6.6), the investigator will need permission from the sponsor to allow the participant to restart study treatment. 7.1.2  Procedures for Discontinuation of Study Treatment The investigator should instruct the participant to contact the site before or at the time the participant decides to stop the study treatment.  A participant who decides to discontinue study treatment must be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs.  The date of last intake of study treatment should be documented in the eCRF.  All study treatment should be returned by the participant at their next on-site study visit or unscheduled visit.  Participants permanently discontinuing study treatment should be given locally available standard of care therapy, at the discretion of the investigator. Discontinuation of study treatment, for any reason, does not impact on the participant's participation in the study.  The participant should continue attending subsequent study visits and data collection should continue according to the study protocol.  If the participant does not agree to continue in-person study visits, a modified follow-up must be arranged to ensure the collection of endpoints and safety information.  This could be a telephone contact with the participant, a contact with a relative or treating physician, or information from medical records.  The approach taken should be recorded in the medical records.  A participant that agrees to modified follow-up is not considered to have withdrawn consent or to have withdrawn from the study. If either abiraterone or capivasertib\/placebo is discontinued prior to disease progression, participants may remain on the other drug at the investigator's discretion until disease progression or evidence of unacceptable toxicity.  Participants who discontinue one of the study treatments but remain on the other should continue to have assessments performed as outlined in the SoA (Table 2).  Once both capivasertib\/placebo and abiraterone treatment are permanently discontinued, procedures should be followed for the discontinuation and follow up visits.  Participants who have permanently discontinued from further receipt of capivasertib\/placebo and abiraterone will need to be discontinued from the IWRS. 7.2  Participant Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioural, compliance, or administrative reasons.  This is expected to be uncommon. A participant who considers withdrawing from the study must be informed by the investigator about modified follow-up options (eg, telephone contact, a contact with a relative or treating physician, or information from medical records). At the time of withdrawal from the study, if possible, an Early Study Intervention Discontinuation visit should be conducted, as shown in the SoA.  See SoA (Table 2) for data to be collected at the time of study withdrawal and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.  All study treatment should be returned by the participant. The participant will discontinue the study intervention and be withdrawn from the study at that time. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study, it should be confirmed if they still agree for existing samples to be used in line with the original consent.  If the participant requests withdrawal of consent for use of samples, destruction of any samples taken and not tested should be carried in line with what was stated in the informed consent and local regulation.  The investigator must document the decision on use of existing samples in the site study records and inform the Global Study Team. A participant who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs.  The investigator will follow-up participants as medically indicated.  The participant will return electronic PRO (ePRO) devices. AstraZeneca or its delegate will request investigators to make every effort to collect information on participants' survival status (dead or alive; date of death when applicable) at the end of the study, including participants that withdrew consent or are classified as \u2018lost to follow up'.  Survival status can be obtained by site personnel from publicly available resources where it is possible, in accordance with local regulations.  Knowledge of the survival status at study end in all participants is crucial for the integrity of the study. 7.3  Lost to Follow-up A participant will be considered potentially lost to follow-up if they repeatedly fail to return for scheduled visits and are unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and\/or should continue in the study. Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant's last known mailing address or local equivalent methods).  These contact attempts should be documented in the participant's medical record. Efforts to reach the participant should continue until the end of the study.  Should the participant be unreachable at the end of the study, the participant should be considered to be lost to follow-up with unknown vital status at the end of study. Site personnel, or an independent third party, will attempt to collect the vital status of the participant within legal and ethical boundaries for all participants randomised, including those who did not receive investigational product.  Public sources may be searched for vital status information.  If vital status is determined as deceased, this will be documented and the participant will not be considered lost to follow-up.  Sponsor personnel will not be involved in any attempts to collect vital status information. Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole are handled as described in Appendix B 9. 8  STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarised in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria.  The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the participant's routine clinical management (eg, blood count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilised for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedures met the protocol-specified criteria and were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA. The investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the eCRFs.  A Web-based Data Capture system will be used for data collection and query handling. The investigator must ensure the accuracy and completeness for eCRFs, which includes legibility and timeliness of the data recorded and of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement.  The investigator will sign the completed eCRFs.  A copy of the completed eCRFs will be archived at the study site. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples. 8.1  Efficacy Assessments 8.1.1  Tumour Assessments Tumour assessments will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and a bone scan for whole body.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before randomisation, and ideally, should be performed as close as possible to randomisation.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) relative to the date of randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), regardless of discontinuation of study treatment (eg, discontinuation due to toxicity or clinical progression) or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy. The assessments by different imaging modalities (eg, CT and bone scintigraphy) can be done on different days but should all be performed within the assessment schedule.  It is important to follow the imaging assessment schedule as closely as possible; however, tumour assessment can be performed at any time when disease progression is clinically suspected.  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged.  If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at the participant's scheduled visits. Participants who discontinue study treatment prior to progression should continue to be scanned until progression.  The same imaging modality and the same assessment (eg, the same contrast protocol for CT scans) should be performed at baseline and at all follow-up time points. Radiological examinations performed during the study should be retained at site as source data. 8.1.2  Evaluation of Disease Progression 8.1.2.1  Radiographic PFS Radiographic PFS is defined as the time from randomisation to: 1) radiographic progression, as assessed by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), or 2) death due to any cause regardless of whether the participant withdraws from randomised treatment or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression. Radiographic PFS will be measured by investigator assessment, and a sensitivity analysis of PFS assessed by BICR will also be conducted (see Section 8.1.2.4). The definitions of measurable, non-measurable, target and non-target lesions for assessment of soft tissue using RECIST 1.1 criteria, methods of assessment, and the objective tumour response criteria are provided in Appendix E 2.  The PCWG3 guidelines are provided in Appendix E 3. Participants who have not progressed, as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) or PCWG3 criteria (bone), or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 assessment.  However, if the participant progresses or dies immediately after 2 or more consecutive missed visits, the participant will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 bone assessment prior to the 2 missed visits. 8.1.2.2  Evaluation of Soft Tissue Lesions The criteria for objective tumour response on soft tissue lesions will be based on RECIST 1.1: CR (complete response), PR (partial response), SD (stable disease), PD (progressive disease), NE (not evaluable), and NED (no evidence of disease). For participants with measurable lesion at baseline, target lesion progression will be calculated in reference to the smallest tumour burden on study (ie, the smallest sum of diameters previously recorded on study).  In the absence of progression, target lesion response will be calculated using as reference the baseline tumour measurements obtained before starting treatment.  For these participants, the objective tumour response assessment options are CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE. For participants with non-measurable soft tissue lesions only at baseline, the objective tumour response assessment options are CR, PD, Non CR\/Non PD, and NE. For participants with bone lesions only and no soft tissue disease at baseline, the objective tumour response assessment options will be NED, PD (if a new soft tissue lesion appears), or NE (if the scan is not performed). If the investigator is in doubt as to whether disease progression has occurred, particularly with regard to non-target lesions or the appearance of a new lesion, it is advisable to continue treatment and reassess the tumour burden at the next scheduled assessment or sooner if clinically indicated.  If repeat scans confirm progression, then the date of the initial scan should be declared as the date of progression.  New bone lesions should not be counted in the RECIST assessment. To achieve \u2018unequivocal progression' on the basis of non-target lesions, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest \u2018increase' in the size of 1 or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. 8.1.2.3  Evaluation of Bone Lesions Progression on a bone scan is identified using PCWG3 criteria, by having 2 or more new metastatic bone lesions. For participants without progression at the first visit after baseline, the scan from this first visit after baseline now serves as new reference for all subsequent scans, ie, assuming all visits are acquired according to schedule, all bone scans after Week 16 are compared to the Week 16 scan. The requirements for determination of radiographic progression by either bone scan (bone progression) or CT\/MRI (soft tissue progression) are summarised in Table 6. Table 6  Requirements for Documentation of Radiographic Progression Visit Date  Visit Date   None Criteria for Bone Progression  Criteria for Bone Progression Criteria for Soft Tissue Progression  Criteria for Soft Tissue Progression First tumour assessment after baseline  First tumour assessment after baseline \u2022  \u2022 \u2022  \u2022 2 or more new lesions compared to baseline bone scan, and  2 or more new lesions compared to baseline bone scan, and Confirmed by an additional 2 or more new lesions compared to the first post-baseline bone scan at least  Confirmed by an additional 2 or more new lesions compared to the first post-baseline bone scan at least 6 weeks later  6 weeks later Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1  Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1 No confirmation required  No confirmation required From the second tumour assessment after baseline  From the second tumour assessment after baseline \u2022  \u2022 \u2022  \u2022 2 or more new lesions compared to the first bone scan after baseline No confirmation required  2 or more new lesions compared to the first bone scan after baseline No confirmation required Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1  Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1 No confirmation required  No confirmation required Visit Date None Criteria for Bone Progression Criteria for Soft Tissue Progression First tumour assessment after baseline \u2022 \u2022 2 or more new lesions compared to baseline bone scan, and Confirmed by an additional 2 or more new lesions compared to the first post-baseline bone scan at least 6 weeks later Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1 No confirmation required From the second tumour assessment after baseline \u2022 \u2022 2 or more new lesions compared to the first bone scan after baseline No confirmation required Progressive disease on CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1 No confirmation required CT Computed tomography; MRI Magnetic resonance imaging; RECIST Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. 8.1.2.4  Central Reading of Scans A BICR of the scans will be conducted and the results used in a sensitivity analysis of rPFS. Images, including unscheduled visit scans, will be collected on an ongoing basis and sent to an AstraZeneca-appointed imaging Contract Research Organisation (iCRO) for QC, storage, and for BICR.  Digital copies of all original scans should be stored at the investigator site as source documents.  Electronic image transfer from the sites to the iCRO is strongly encouraged.  A BICR of images will be performed at the discretion of AstraZeneca.  Results of these independent reviews will not be communicated to investigators, and results of investigator tumour assessments will not be shared with the central reviewers.  The management of participants will be based solely upon the results of the RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and PCWG3 (bone) assessment conducted by the investigator. All treatment decisions will be based on site assessment of scans.  After the primary rPFS analysis, central review of scans will no longer be required, and investigators will be advised when to stop sending copies of the scans to the CRO conducting the central review. 8.1.2.5  PFS2 PFS2 is defined as the time from randomisation until progression on next-line treatment (ie, the line of treatment following the first progression in the study), as clinical progression, PSA progression, or radiographic progression determined by RECIST version 1.1 (soft tissue) and\/or PCWG3 criteria (bone) as assessed by the investigator, or death due to any cause.  Censoring details will be defined in the SAP. A participant will enter the PFS2 follow-up period once that participant has discontinued study treatment due to progressive disease by RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue lesions and\/or PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions. The participant's status at first progression will be used as the reference for assessment of PFS2. RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3 assessments will not be collected for assessment of PFS2. The date of PFS2 assessment and the investigator's opinion of progression status (progressed or non-progressed) at each assessment will be recorded in the eCRF.  Determination of progressive disease for PFS2 will be by institutional call. 8.1.3  Overall Survival Overall survival is the length of time from randomisation until the date of death due to any cause.  In the survival follow-up period, all subsequent cancer therapies and vital status will be documented at least every 12 weeks until death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first. Any participant not known to have died at the time of analysis will be censored based on the last recorded date on which the participant was known to be alive. Survival information may be obtained via telephone contact with the participant, participant's family, by contact with the participant's current physician, or local death registries as described in Section 7.3. Survival calls will be made in the week following the date of DCO for each of the rPFS or OS analyses.  If participants are confirmed to be alive or if the death date is after the DCO date, these participants will be censored at the date of DCO. 8.1.4  Time to PSA Progression Time to PSA progression is defined as the time from randomisation to PSA progression, as determined by PCWG3 criteria: PSA progression is the date that an increase of 25% or more and absolute increase of 2 ng\/mL or more from the nadir are documented, which is confirmed by a second value obtained 3 or more weeks later.  Censoring details for this endpoint will be defined in the SAP. Blood samples for PSA measurements will be collected and evaluated by the local testing laboratory at timelines as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  These assessments should continue until disease progression, regardless of discontinuation of study treatment. 8.1.5  Time to First Subsequent Therapy Time to First Subsequent Therapy (TFST) is defined as time from randomisation to the earlier of start date of the first subsequent anticancer therapy after discontinuation of randomised treatment, or death due to any cause. All anticancer treatments (including, but not limited to, chemotherapy and targeted agents), and the investigator's opinion of response to these treatments plus the date of progression, following discontinuation of study treatment, must be recorded.  Subsequent systemic anticancer therapies (excluding radiotherapy) will be reviewed prior to data unblinding to assess which represent clinically important treatments intended to control prostate cancer.  Any participant not known to have died at the time of the analysis and not known to have had a further anticancer therapy will be censored at the last known time to have not received subsequent therapy, ie, the last follow-up visit where this was confirmed. 8.1.6  SSE-FS Symptomatic skeletal event-free survival (SSE-FS) is defined as the time from randomisation until any of the following (or death due to any cause): Use of radiation therapy to prevent or relieve skeletal symptoms. Occurrence of new symptomatic pathological bone fractures (vertebral or non-vertebral).  Radiologic documentation is required.  A pathological fracture, as determined by investigator, is defined as associated with low or no trauma and deemed to have occurred at a site of bone metastasis. Occurrence of spinal cord compression.  Radiologic documentation is required. Orthopaedic surgical intervention for bone metastasis. Participants who have not experienced any of the above conditions will be censored at the time of the last SSE assessment. Assessments for symptomatic skeletal events will be performed at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 1.3), and should continue beyond disease progression, regardless of discontinuation of study treatment. 8.1.7  Time to Castration Resistance Time to castration resistance (TTCR) is defined as the time from randomisation to the first castration-resistant event (radiographic disease progression, PSA progression, or SSE), whichever occurs first, at castrate levels of testosterone (below 50 ng\/dL).  Censoring details will be defined in the SAP. The timepoints of assessments for radiographic progression and SSEs, and collection of samples for determination of PSA and serum testosterone levels are indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3). 8.1.8  Patient-reported Outcomes A clinical outcome assessment (COA) is an assessment of a clinical outcome reported by a clinician, a patient, or a non-clinician observer, or through a performance-based assessment (FDA-NIH BEST Resource).  A COA may be used in clinical studies to provide either direct or indirect evidence of treatment benefit.  It is important to examine the impact of therapy on disease-related symptoms, physical function, and other HRQoL of the patient to aid understanding of how clinical benefit relates to patient well-being and for consideration in making risk-benefit evaluations.  PRO is one type of clinical outcome assessment and is a general term referring to all outcomes and symptoms that are directly reported by the patient.  Moreover, PROs assist in the documentation of symptoms and specifically what symptoms and impacts are most important to patients and how these relate to clinical outcomes.  PROs have become important in evaluating effectiveness of study treatments in clinical studies and will aid in understanding of the benefit\/risk evaluation (Kluetz et al 2018).  The following PROs will be administered in this study: BPI-SF, BFI, FACT-P, PGIS, EQ-5D-5L, and selected questions from the PRO-CTCAE items library.  Samples of the PRO questionnaires are provided in Appendix F.  PROs will be administered according to the SoA (Section 1.3).  PROs will be provided in the native language(s) of the country in which they will be administered, except for PRO-CTCAE, which will only be administered in the languages where a linguistically validated version is available. 8.1.8.1  BPI-SF The BPI-SF (Appendix F 1) is a validated, 15-item domain-specific instrument designed to assess the severity of pain and the impact\/interference of pain on daily functions (Cleeland and Ryan 1994).  The BPI-SF will be scored according to the user guide (Cleeland 2009).  All BPI-SF pain items including \u2018worst pain' is scored on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS) with 0 = No Pain and 10 = Worst Pain Imaginable.  This instrument consists of 2 domains: pain severity and pain interference.  The pain severity domain consists of 4 items (Item 3, Item 4, Item 5, and Item 6) which assess pain at its \u2018worst,' \u2018least,' \u2018average,' and \u2018now' (current pain) respectively on the 11-point NRS.  These 4 items may be averaged as a composite pain severity score or they may be interpreted individually (Dworkin et al 2005, Dworkin et al 2008, FDA 2009, Turk et al 2006).  In this study, the \u2018worst pain' (Item 3) will be used as a single item in assessing pain progression.  A composite pain severity score from all the 4 items will also be evaluated.  A 2- or more point change in the \u2018worst pain' item is considered clinically meaningful. The pain interference domain score is a mean of 7 items: general activity (Item 9A), mood (Item 9B), walking ability (Item 9C), normal work (Item 9D), relations with other people (Item 9E), sleep (Item 9F), and enjoyment of life (Item 9G), each scored on an 11-point NRS from 0 (Does not interfere) to 10 (Completely interferes).  Based on the BPI-SF scoring manual, the following items are not used in scoring pain severity or pain interference domains: Items 1, 2, 7, and 8.  Item 7 (a free text field) describing pain medication use is captured separately in more detail using the analgesic log. The BPI-SF analgesic log (captured on ePRO device) will be completed by the participant as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Further details on the analgesic log and scoring are provided in Sections 8.1.8.8 and 8.1.8.9, respectively. Time to pain progression is a key secondary endpoint of this study (see Section 8.1.8.2).  In addition, change from baseline in pain severity and pain interference domain scores may be derived. 8.1.8.2  Time to Pain Progression The key secondary endpoint of TTPP is defined as the time from randomisation to the time point at which clinically meaningful pain progression is observed, based on a 2-point increase from baseline in the BPI-SF Item 3 \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' score and\/or initiation of\/increase in opiate analgesic use.  A minimum of 4 days of data is required.  The criteria for pain progression depend on whether a participant is asymptomatic or symptomatic at baseline: Asymptomatic participants at baseline (average BPI-SF Item 3 score of 0 and not taking opioids) Increase of 2 or more points in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' (BPI-SF Item 3) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks) OR Initiation of opioid use for pain Symptomatic participants at baseline (average BPI-SF Item 3 score > 0 and\/or currently taking opioids) Increase of 2 or more points in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) \u2018worst pain in 24 hours' (BPI-SF Item 3) from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks) and an average worst pain score \u2265 4, and no decrease in average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or more points decrease in AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher OR Increase in the average (ie, average of 7-day assessments) opioid use measured as 1 or more points increase (or at least 2 points increase if the starting value is 0) in the AQA score from baseline observed at 2 consecutive follow-up assessments\/visits (separated by 3 to 4 weeks). Participants satisfying one or more of the criteria above will be considered to have pain progression.  Participants who do not satisfy any of the criteria above will be censored at the time of the last known assessment that showed an absence of pain progression. Censoring A number of situations will lead to a participant's time to pain progression being censored; these are as follows: If a participant meets the criteria for pain progression after 2 or more missed visits (visits which showed < 4 days of BPI-SF worst pain [Item 3] assessments and the average AQA score does not meet the progression criteria), then the participant will be censored at the time of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used). Participants who have not met the criteria for pain progression at the time of analysis: The censoring date will be the date of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used). Participants with no evaluable baseline or post-baseline data will be censored at Day 1. For participants who receive subsequent anticancer therapy: The censoring date will be the date of the latest evaluable average BPI-SF \u2018worst pain' assessment prior to the start date of subsequent anticancer therapy (the earliest date of the assessments contributing to the average will be used) Participants with no evaluable baseline or post-baseline data will be censored at Day 1. 8.1.8.3  Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) The BFI (Appendix F 2) is a self-administered instrument developed to assess the severity of fatigue and the impact of fatigue on functioning (Mendoza et al 1999).  It includes 9 items which measure fatigue severity (3 items) and fatigue interference (6 items).  The first 3 items (Item 1, Item 2, and Item 3) ask participants about their: level of fatigue right now, usual level of fatigue within the past 24 hours, and fatigue at its worst level within the past 24 hours on an 11-point NRS of 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (as bad as you can imagine).  The 6 fatigue interference items (Item 4A, Item 4B, Item 4C, Item 4D, Item 4E, and Item 4F, respectively) evaluate participants on the extent to which fatigue interfered with their daily activities (ie, general activity, mood, walking, work, relationships, and enjoyment of life) on an 11-point NRS of 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).  While not developed specifically for prostate cancer or mHSPC, its reliability and clinical and concurrent validity have been demonstrated in cancer more generally (Mendoza et al 1999, Whitehead 2009).  It has also been used to measure fatigue in one mHSPC study (LATITUDE, Fizazi et al 2019) and one mCRPC study (COU-AA-301, Sternberg et al 2013), respectively.  The items\/scales used to measure fatigue in LATITUDE are not specified.  In COU-AA-301, fatigue was measured via \u2018fatigue intensity', defined as the score of the worst fatigue item (Item 3), and \u2018fatigue interference', defined as the average score of all the interference items (Items 4A - 4F).  A clinically important difference in \u2018fatigue intensity' was defined in this study as a change in \u2265 2 points from baseline, while a change in \u2265 1.25 points from baseline for \u2018fatigue interference' was considered clinically meaningful (Sternberg et al 2013).  These clinically important thresholds will be used in the current study. In this study, the \u2018worst fatigue' (Item 3) will be used as a single item in assessing deterioration in \u2018fatigue intensity'.  Also, a composite or mean score of 3 items (Items 1-3) will be evaluated as \u2018fatigue severity'.  Finally, a \u2018fatigue interference' domain score will be based on a mean of the 6 interference items (Items 4A-4F). The following may be derived as secondary endpoints: Time to deterioration in fatigue intensity (defined as a change \u2265 2 points from baseline in worst fatigue item [Item 3] score). Time to deterioration in fatigue interference (defined as a change \u2265 1.25 points from baseline in fatigue interference domain score). Change from baseline in fatigue severity and fatigue interference domain scores. 8.1.8.4  FACT-P The FACT-P (Appendix F 3) is a disease-specific 39-item questionnaire included for the purpose of assessing HRQoL and prostate cancer-specific symptoms.  It is a well-established measure of HRQoL\/health status commonly used in prostate cancer studies.  The FACT-P was developed specifically for patients with advanced prostate cancer and has been found to be reliable and valid in this population (Esper et al 1997).  The FACT-P consists of 5 subscales: Physical Well-Being (PWB; 7 items), Functional Well-Being (FWB; 7 items), Emotional Well-Being (EWB; 6 items), Social Well-Being (SWB; 7 items), and Additional Concerns or Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS) specific to prostate cancer (12 items).  All FACT-P questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 to 4 (0 being not at all and 4 being very much).  Negatively stated items are reversed by subtracting the response from 4.  For all subscales, symptoms index, and individual item scores, the higher the score, the better the HRQoL\/symptom.  In addition to the Total and Subscale scores, the FACT-P also supports the calculation of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) total score (sum of PWB, SWB, EWB, and FWB scores), a Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score (the sum of the PWB, FWB, and PCS scores), and the FACT Advanced Prostate Symptom Index-6 (FAPSI-6), a symptom score made up of 6 items from within the FACT-P (3 pain items, 1 fatigue item, 1 weight loss item, and 1 condition getting worse item). The following may be derived as other secondary endpoints: Time to deterioration in FACT-P scores (FACT-P total score, FACT-G total score, TOI, functional well-being, physical well-being, prostate cancer subscale, and FAPSI-6, respectively). Change from baseline in FACT-P scores (FACT-P total score, FACT-G total score, TOI, functional well-being, physical well-being, prostate cancer subscale, and FAPSI-6, respectively). 8.1.8.5  PRO-CTCAE The PRO-CTCAE (Appendix F 5) will only be administered where a linguistically validated version exists for a country. PRO-CTCAE was developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and is included to address tolerability from the patients' perspective.  PRO-CTCAE is an item library of symptoms experienced by patients while undergoing treatment of their cancer.  It was developed in recognition that collecting treatment-related symptom data directly from patients using PRO tools can improve the accuracy and efficiency of symptomatic AE data collection.  This was based on findings from multiple studies demonstrating that physicians and nurses underestimate symptom onset, frequency, and severity in comparison with patient ratings (Basch et al 2009, Litwin et al 1998, Sprangers and Aaronson 1992).  To date, 78 symptoms of the CTCAE have been identified to be amenable to patient reporting.  These symptoms have been converted to patient terms (eg, CTCAE term \u2018myalgia' converted to \u2018aching muscles').  The items included in the PRO-CTCAE have undergone extensive qualitative review among experts and patients.  Using cognitive testing methods, these items and the additional questions for some of the symptoms have been extensively evaluated by cancer patients, so that symptoms of interest are clear, comprehendible, and measurable.  Not all items are administered in any one clinical study.  The intention is to only ask participants to complete those items considered relevant for the study, site of cancer, and cancer treatment.  Participants on all study arms will complete the same selection of symptom items for the PRO-CTCAE.  Several decision rules were applied to the selection to achieve an unbiased selection and reasonable patient completion time.  Safety data for capivasertib, abiraterone acetate, and hormonal treatments (administered in both arms of the study) informed the symptom selection.  Safety and AE data for capivasertib was accessed via the most recent IB, while the US Package Inserts were used to assess the abiraterone and ADT.  Symptomatic AEs from the PRO-CTCAE items library that are considered relevant based on the reported safety and AEs for capivasertib, abiraterone, and hormonal treatments were selected for this study (see Appendix F 5). The Free Text item in the PRO-CTCAE instrument is not included in this study, as the utility of this information and the analysis method have not been established.  The full list of items is available in Appendix F 5. 8.1.8.6  PGIS The impact of treatment on the overall severity of cancer symptoms over the past week will be assessed using the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) single-item questionnaire (Appendix F 4).  PGIS is useful for determining the responder threshold of other PRO measures. 8.1.8.7  EQ-5D-5L The EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal (EuroQol Group 1990).  Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in population health surveys.  The questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions as follows: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain\/discomfort, and anxiety\/depression.  Each dimension has 5 response options (\u2018no problems', \u2018slight problems', \u2018moderate problems', \u2018severe problems', and \u2018extreme problems') that reflect increasing levels of difficulty (EuroQol Group 2013). Previous versions of EQ-5D had only 3 levels of difficulty, EQ-5D-3L.  Since 2009, the EuroQol Group developed a more sensitive version of the EQ-5D (the EQ-5D-5L) that expands the range of responses to each dimension from 3 to 5 levels of increasing severity (Herdman et al 2011).  Preliminary studies indicate that the 5L version improves upon the properties of the 3L measure in terms of reduced ceiling effect, increased reliability, and an improved ability to differentiate between different levels of health (Janssen et al 2008a, Janssen et al 2008b, Pickard et al 2007).  A sample of the EQ-5D-5L is provided in Appendix F 6. The participant will be asked to indicate their current health state by selecting the most appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensions.  The questionnaire also includes a visual analog scale, where the participant will be asked to rate current health status on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst imaginable health state. 8.1.8.8  Analgesic Log The analgesic log will be implemented using the ERT Medication Module\u2122, a component of the ERT eCOA System that serves for accurately tracking subject consumption of concomitant and\/or rescue medications.  The Medication Module allows medication data capture via the ERT eCOA Universal App, followed by the review and management of that data by sites and sponsors.  The Medication Module provides a consistent, easier-to-use and more efficient tool compared with paper-based reporting.  Using the module, participants will record all analgesic medication dosages and dosage times to track pain medications use.  The Medication Module includes the following components: Global Master Medication List: This list will be developed collaboratively by ERT and AstraZeneca and will contain all approved analgesic drug names including generic names and formulations.  The list will be updated over the course of the study via an approval workflow process, when necessary. eCOA Universal App Medication Diary: The medication diary will allow participants to log analgesic medication intake during scheduled assessments.  Study sites will check and update the medication diary for participants as needed throughout the study. Medication Report: This may be used to remotely update the tailored list of medications available on a participant's eCOA Universal App. The analgesic log is study specific (not generic) and screenshots will be available and submitted along with the CSP to IRB\/IECs. Although information on all analgesics used by participants in pain control will be collected using the analgesic log, only changes in opiate are considered in pain progression evaluation in line with FDA recommendation.  Opiates consumed by participants will be converted into oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) as defined in Chung et al 2014.  The analgesic quantification algorithm (AQA) developed by Chung et al 2014 will be used to quantify and score analgesic use in the study.  The AQA is an 8-point scale that assigns a score as follows: 0 = No analgesic 1 = Non-opioid analgesics 2 = Weak opioids (eg, codeine, tramadol) 3 = Strong opioids \u2264 75 mg OME per day 4 = Strong opioids > 75 to 150 mg OME per day 5 = Strong opioids > 150 to 300 mg OME per day 6 = Strong opioids > 300 to 600 mg OME per day 7 = Strong opioids > 600 mg OME per day 8.1.8.9  Analgesic Use Scoring Opiate analgesic use (AQA score) will be assessed at timelines specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  The average daily OME will require at least 4 days of data and will be used to assign the AQA score.  An increase of 1 point or more in the AQA score from a starting value of 1 or higher OR \u2265 2 points in AQA score from a starting value of 0 is considered a clinically meaningful increase in opiate use.  Similarly, a decrease of 1 point or more in the AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher is considered a clinically meaningful decrease in opiate use. 8.1.8.10  Administration of PRO Questionnaires The PRO instruments will be self-administered at home by the participants using handheld devices at the time points indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Participants may complete the ePROs at study sites if the assessment time point coincides with a scheduled site visit; otherwise, participants may complete the ePROs at home.  The analgesic use log using the ERT Medication Module\u2122 will also be administered electronically alongside the ePROs.  If there is a technical issue with the device, the site will have access to a web-based back up. Each site must allocate the responsibility for the administration of the ePRO instruments to a specific individual (eg, a research nurse or study coordinator) and, if possible, assign a backup person to cover if that individual is absent. Approximately 15 to 30 minutes is required for participants to complete the questionnaires. The below instructions should be followed when collecting PRO data via an electronic device: PRO questionnaires completed at site visits must be completed prior to treatment administration and ideally before any discussions of health status to avoid biasing the participant's responses to the questions.  As feasible, site staff should also ensure PRO questionnaires are completed prior to other study procedures, such as collection of laboratory samples, to further minimise bias. When each instrument is due to be completed, the following order will be observed: BPI-SF, BFI, Analgesic Log, FACT-P, PGIS, EQ-5D-5L, and then PRO-CTCAE. PRO questionnaires should be completed by the participant in a quiet and private location. The participant should be given sufficient time to complete the questionnaires at their own speed. The research nurse or appointed site staff must explain to participants the value and relevance of ePRO participation, so they are motivated to comply with questionnaire completion.  Inform the participant that these questions are being asked to find out, directly from them, how they feel. The research nurse or appointed site staff should stress that the information is not routinely shared with study staff. Therefore, if the participant has any medical problems, they should discuss them with the doctor or research nurse separately from the ePRO assessment. The research nurse or appointed site staff must train the participant on how to use the PRO device, using the materials and training provided by the ePRO vendor. The research nurse or appointed site staff must provide guidance on whom to call if there are problems with the device if the participant is completing the ePRO at home. All questionnaires must be completed using the ePRO device; paper questionnaires are not allowed in this study. The research nurse or appointed site staff must remind participants there are no right or wrong answers and avoid introducing bias by not clarifying items for the participant. The participant should not receive help from relatives, friends, or clinic staff to respond to the ePRO questionnaires.  The responses are the participant's alone. On completion of the questionnaire at the site, the device should be handed back to the designated responsible person, who should check that all questionnaires were completed. If a participant uses visual aids (eg, spectacles or contact lenses) for reading and does not have them when he or she attends the clinic, the participant will be exempted from completing the ePROs at that clinic visit, though they can complete them at home if within the allowable window. Site staff must not read or complete the ePRO questionnaires on behalf of the participant.  If the participant is unable to read the questionnaire (eg, is blind or illiterate), that participant is exempted from completing PRO questionnaires but may still participate in the study.  If the participant cannot complete the ePRO questionnaires due to other than being blind or illiterate, the AstraZeneca study team must be contacted to determine if they can be exempted.  This includes requirements for screening questionnaires.  Participants exempted in this regard should be flagged appropriately by the site staff in the source documents and in the Review of PRO\/Questionnaire\/Diary (REVPRDI) eCRF. Site staff must administer questionnaires available in the language that the participant speaks and understands.  Questions should not be read in an available language and translated into another language for the participant. It is vital that the ePRO reporting is conducted at the Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1 visit, as specified in the SoA.  The participant should bring the device to every site visit so the site can confirm the device is functioning properly.  It is especially critical the participant bring the device to the Cycle 1, Week 1, Day 1 visit so not to miss the assessments that have baseline at this visit.  The ePRO device must be charged and fully functional at the beginning of the baseline visit to ensure that the PROs can be completed at the start of the visit. Finally, the research nurse or appointed site staff will review the completion status of questionnaires during site visits and document the reason(s) why a participant could not complete assessments either in the REVPRDI eCRF or the device depending on the set-up for the study. Reminders should be sent to the participant at home as needed to ensure compliance with the assessment schedules.  The research nurse or appointed site staff must monitor compliance, since minimising missing data is a key aspect of study success.  It is important that the PRO device is charged and fully functional.  Compliance must be checked at each study visit and should be checked more frequently to identify problems early.  If compliance drops below 88%, they will be flagged in the routine compliance report generated by the ePRO system, and a check-in call from the study site to ask the participant if he or she has any difficulties is highly recommended.  A solution to enhance\/resolve compliance should be discussed with the participant.  Discussions and compliance review should be reflected in source documents. 8.1.8.11  Unify Mobile Software Application The electronic device containing the PRO instruments will also contain a Unify mobile software application.  The Unify mobile software application, and associated website system, will provide digital support to patients from screening through to, and including, follow-up.  The system will provide patients and site study staff with information and tools relevant to the conduct of the study in accordance with this CSP.  This will comprise treatment medication reminders, clinical visit reminders, and educational content relating to the disease and medication. 8.2  Safety Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Section 1.3). 8.2.1  Physical Examinations The physical examination will be performed at timelines as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3) and will include an assessment of the following: general appearance, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdomen skin, head and neck (including ears, eyes, nose and throat), lymph nodes, thyroid, musculoskeletal (including spine and extremities) and neurological systems. Weight and height will be assessed at timelines as specified in the SoA. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses, new or worsening abnormalities may qualify as AEs. 8.2.2  Vital Signs Vital signs (including blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature) will be assessed at timelines as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed with a completely automated device.  Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones). Vital signs will be measured in a supine position after 10 minutes rest and will include temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse.  Three readings of blood pressure and pulse will be taken and should be reported in the participant's notes.  The first reading should be rejected.  The second and third readings should be averaged to give the measurement to be recorded in the eCRF. 8.2.3  Electrocardiograms Triplicate 12-lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (Section 1.3). All ECGs to be conducted as triplicate measurements, within approximately 5 minutes of starting (the 3 ECGs separated by approximately 2 minutes).  Assessments should be performed as close as possible to, but within 30 minutes of the nominal time point. The timing and number of ECGs may be altered depending on the emerging PK and safety profile.  Additional ECGs may be taken at the discretion of the investigator. Twelve-lead ECGs will be obtained after the participant has been resting semi-supine for at least 10 minutes prior to the times indicated.  All ECGs should be recorded with the participant in the same physical position.  A standardised ECG machine should be used and the participant should be examined using the same machine throughout the study if possible. After paper ECGs have been recorded, the investigator or designated physician will review each of the ECGs and may refer to a local cardiologist if appropriate.  A paper copy should be filed in the participant's medical records. If an abnormal ECG finding at screening or baseline is considered clinically significant by the investigator, it should be reported as a concurrent condition.  For all ECGs, details of intervals PR, R-R, QRS, QT, and QTcF and an overall evaluation will be recorded (normal; abnormal, non-clinically significant or abnormal, clinically significant). 8.2.4  Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis will be taken at the visits indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3). Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator.  The date, time of collection and results (values, units, and reference ranges) will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. The clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis will be performed at a local laboratory at or near to the investigator site.  Sample tubes and sample sizes may vary depending on laboratory method used and routine practice at the site. Laboratory values that meet the criteria for CTCAE grade 3 or have changed significantly from baseline and are considered to be of clinical concern will be repeated\/confirmed within 7 days and followed up as appropriate. The investigator should assess the available results with regard to clinically relevant abnormalities.  The laboratory results should be signed and dated and retained at centre as source data for laboratory variables.  For information on how AEs based on laboratory tests should be recorded and reported, see Section 8.3.6. Table 7 lists the clinical safety laboratory variables to be measured.

On blood glucose assessment days (incorporating clinical chemistry and glucose) it is requested that participants refrain from caloric intake for \u2265 4 hours prior to the morning dose of study treatment. Glucose (fasting) is to be measured at screening, pre-dose; at 1 hour and 4 hours post-dose in Cycle 1, Day 1; pre-dose on Cycle 1, Day 15; pre-dose in Cycle 2, Day 1; and at discontinuation of study treatment. Further glucose monitoring may be performed at the investigator's discretion in Cycles 1 and 2 based on the participant's characteristics (ie, diabetes or high risk of hyperglycaemia), and in Cycle 3 onwards based on results during Cycles 1 and 2. HbA1c is to be measured at screening, every 16 weeks from Cycle 1, Day 1, and at discontinuation of study treatment. Note: in addition to the fasted glucose assessments identified in the SoA (Section 1.3), random glucose measurements are to be performed (and recorded) as part of the standard clinical chemistry assessments throughout the study. 8.2.4.2  Serum Creatinine After Cycle 2 onwards, participants taking capivasertib\/placebo and metformin in combination should have creatinine assessments conducted as part of the routine clinical chemistry with additional monitoring of creatinine at the discretion of the investigator. 8.2.5  MUGA Scan\/Echocardiogram Assessments will be performed at screening and thereafter as clinically indicated.  Bidimensional echocardiography (Echo) is the preferred modality because of the global technetium [Tc-99m] shortage (but MUGA can be used alternatively). The modality of the cardiac function assessments must be consistent within participant, ie, if echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment and a follow-up assessment if clinically indicated, then echocardiogram should also be used for subsequent scans if required.  The participant should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible. 8.3  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The Principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix H. AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorised representative). The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE.  For information on how to follow up AEs see Section 8.3.2. 8.3.1  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information Adverse events, including SAEs, will be collected from time of signature of the ICF, throughout the treatment period and including the 30-day follow-up period after discontinuation of study drug.  * *In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs\/SAEs must be reported. If the investigator becomes aware of a SAE with a suspected causal relationship to the IMP that occurs after the end of the clinical study in a participant treated by him or her, the investigator shall, without undue delay, report the SAE to the sponsor. 8.3.2  Follow-up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE\/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits\/contacts.  All SAEs\/non-serious AEs (as defined in Appendix H), will be followed until resolution, stabilisation, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up. A post-study assessment will be performed preferably within 7 days of the time that the IMP is permanently discontinued. Safety follow-up should be carried out with the participant 30 days (+ 7 days) after the discontinuation of study treatment to follow-up any SAEs\/AEs and concomitant medications (including any subsequent cancer therapy). Any AE\/SAE\/abnormal laboratory findings that are ongoing at the time of study treatment discontinuation or any new treatment related events within 30 days of study treatment, must be followed up to resolution or until the event becomes stable (or returns to baseline) or is unlikely to resolve further in the opinion of the investigator. Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant's last AE assessment or other assessment\/visit as appropriate in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF.  AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any participant with ongoing AE(s)\/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 8.3.3  Adverse Event Variables The following variables will be collected for each AE: AE (verbatim) The date when the AE started and stopped CTCAE grade and changes in CTCAE grade Whether the AE is serious or not Investigator causality rating against the IMP(s) (yes or no) Action taken with regard to IMP(s) AE caused participant's withdrawal from study (yes or no) Outcome. In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: Date AE met criteria for serious AE Date investigator became aware of SAE AE is serious due to Date of hospitalisation Date of discharge Probable cause of death Date of death Autopsy performed Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) Causality assessment to other medication 8.3.4  Causality Collection The investigator should assess the causal relationship between the IMP and each AE, and answer \u2018yes' or \u2018no' to the question \u2018Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?' For SAEs, causal relationship should also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as \u2018yes'. A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix H. 8.3.5  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the participant or reported in response to the open question from the study site staff (eg, \u2018Have you had any health problems since the previous visit\/you were last asked?'), or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF.  When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 8.3.6  Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests The results from the CSP-mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG abnormalities should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria, are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product or are considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the investigator (which may include but not limited to consideration as to whether treatment or non-planned visits were required or other action was taken with the study treatment, eg, dose adjustment or drug interruption). If deterioration in a laboratory value\/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result\/vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE\/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally related to the disease under study (see Section 8.3.8). 8.3.7  Hy's Law Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT \u2265 3xULN together with total bilirubin \u2265 2xULN may need to be reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix G for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy's Law. 8.3.8  Disease Progression Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a participant's condition attributable to the disease for which the investigational product is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and\/or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The development of new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events that are unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an AE during the study. 8.3.9  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational product, or to the study procedure(s)*.  All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. *In Screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting). If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately.  investigators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the EDC system, an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the EDC system is not available, then the investigator or other study site staff reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the investigator\/study site staff how to proceed. For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix H. The reference document for definition of expectedness\/listedness for capivasertib is the current IB; for abiraterone, the local prescribing information is the reference document for definition of expectedness\/listedness. 8.3.10  Pregnancy Paternal Exposure Participants should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 16 weeks following the last dose of capivasertib\/placebo. Pregnancy of the participants' partners is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until 16 weeks after the last dose should, if possible, be followed up and documented. 8.3.11  Medication Error If a medication error occurs in the course of the study, then the investigator or other site personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is completed within 1 (Initial Fatal\/Life-Threatening or follow up Fatal\/Life-Threatening) or 5 (other serious initial and follow up) calendar days if there is an SAE associated with the medication error (see Section 8.3.9) and within 30 days for all other medication errors. The definition of a Medication Error can be found in Appendix H 4. 8.3.12  Management of Capivasertib-related Toxicities 8.3.12.1  Capivasertib\/Placebo Dose Modification and Guidance Please refer to Section 6.6 for guidance on dose modifications. 8.3.12.2  Dose Modifications due to General Capivasertib-related Toxicities Treatment with capivasertib\/placebo should be temporarily interrupted for any intolerable AE regardless of grade or for any AEs grade \u2265 3 that occurs despite optimal supportive care, are not attributable to the disease under investigation, where the investigator considers the AE of concern to be specifically associated with capivasertib.  Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related toxicities are shown in Table 8.  Appropriate and optimal treatment of the toxicity is assumed prior to considering dose modifications.  The Study Physician may be consulted prior to discontinuation of study drug due to toxicities.  Please see Section 8.3.12.3 for the management of capivasertib-specific toxicities including hyperglycaemia, maculo-papular rash and other skin reactions, and diarrhoea.

In participants who are diabetic, it may be beneficial to rule out concomitant aetiologies that could be associated with hyperglycaemia (eg, infections, dehydration, vascular events, glucocorticoids). Participants should be made aware of symptoms of hyperglycaemia (eg, polydipsia and polyuria). Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related hyperglycaemia are shown in Table 9.  In addition, for all grades, participants may receive education on lifestyle changes (eg, a diabetic diet) and consider beginning home glucose monitoring (eg, fasting self-blood glucose monitoring once daily) at the discretion of the investigator.  If glucose home monitoring is instituted, the capivasertib\/placebo treatment decision should be based on the morning fasting glucose value obtained prior to the dose of capivasertib\/placebo. It is recommended that approaches to the management of capivasertib-induced hyperglycaemia include advice from a diabetologist where appropriate (eg, participants with diabetes).  Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies (see below for further guidance).  If a second agent is required, consideration should be given to the intermittent schedule of capivasertib and the pattern of glucose changes (eg, sulphonylureas should be avoided due to the risk of hypoglycaemia secondary to their mechanism of action).

NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0; SBGM, self-blood glucose monitoring. Use of metformin Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies.  Investigators should exercise caution in the dosing and management of participants receiving the metformin and capivasertib\/placebo combination and must be vigilant for signs of renal impairment and metformin toxicity, such as lactic acidosis and hypoglycaemia, namely: lethargy, hypotension, poor urine output, drowsiness, irritation, tachypnoea, sweating, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Due to the potential interaction of metformin and capivasertib (caused by the inhibition of renal transporters [eg, OCT2] involved in the excretion of metformin), when taking both capivasertib and metformin concurrently, participants should attend the clinic for monitoring of serum creatinine at least once per week for the first 3 weeks after initiation of metformin, then every 3 weeks thereafter. Metformin should only be given on the days when capivasertib\/placebo is also administered (the half-life of capivasertib is approximately 7 to 15 hours) and should be withdrawn when treatment with capivasertib\/placebo is withdrawn, unless otherwise clinically indicated. Consider withholding of metformin on the days when participants are due to have imaging with contrast (in order to reduce the already low risk of lactic acidosis) as per local guidelines. Maculo-papular Rash Dose modifications for capivasertib-related maculo-papular rash, which is the most frequent skin toxicity observed in participants treated with capivasertib, are provided in Table 10.  However, these management guidelines can be used for other skin toxicities at the discretion of the investigator and\/or following consultation with the dermatologist.

BSA, body surface area; NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. Hypersensitivity In the case of hypersensitivity reactions, capivasertib\/placebo should be discontinued, and symptomatic\/supportive therapy should be initiated (including with antihistamines and\/or steroids) as considered appropriate by the investigator\/treating physician.  Drug re-challenge is not recommended; any subsequent consideration on re-challenge with capivasertib at the same or a lower dose, with its potential for recurrence of such or more severe events should be carefully considered against the potential benefits to the individual participant from continuation of capivasertib therapy and agreed with the sponsor.  Further management should follow local guidelines on management of hypersensitivity reactions. Diarrhoea Participants should be instructed to promptly contact investigators if they develop diarrhoea. Alternative aetiologies should be ruled out prior to initiating the dose modifications.  Investigators are recommended to prescribe anti-diarrhoeal treatment at the first visit so that participants can start treatment at the first sign of diarrhoea, should it occur.  Loperamide is the preferred anti-diarrhoeal agent for the management of diarrhoea occurring in participants participating in studies of capivasertib.  If diarrhoea is reported, additional details regarding this AE will be collected in the eCRF. Dose modifications for capivasertib-related diarrhoea are provided in Table 11.

NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. 8.4  Overdose There is currently no specific treatment in the event of an overdose with capivasertib and possible symptoms of overdose are not established.  Capivasertib must only be used in accordance with the relevant CSP.  AEs associated with overdose should be treated in response to symptoms.  Any dose, or frequency of dosing, that exceeds the dose regimen specified in the CSP should be reported as an overdose.  The maximum tolerated dose for capivasertib is 480 mg BD as monotherapy.  Abiraterone must be used according to local prescribing information. Adverse reactions associated with overdose should be treated symptomatically and should be managed appropriately. An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis\/symptoms on the relevant AE modules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module. An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose eCRF module. If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study drug occurs in the course of the study, the investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives immediately, but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 or 5 calendar days for overdoses associated with an SAE (see Section 8.3.9) and within 30 days for all other overdoses. 8.5  Human Biological Samples Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided in the study specific laboratory manual.  Samples should be stored in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  For further details on Handling of Human Biological Samples see Appendix I. Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years from the date of the issue of the CSR in line with consent and local requirements, after which they will be destroyed\/repatriated. PK samples will be disposed of after the Bioanalytical Report finalisation or 6 months after issuance of the draft Bioanalytical Report (whichever is earlier), unless consented for future analyses. PK samples may be disposed of or anonymised by pooling.  Additional analyses may be conducted on the anonymised, pooled PK samples to further evaluate and validate the analytical method.  Any results from such analyses may be reported separately from the CSR.  Anonymised samples will be retained for no more than 5 years after the CSR is finalised. 8.5.1  Pharmacokinetics Blood samples of approximately 2 mL will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of capivasertib as specified in the SoA (Table 2). Samples from participants dosed with placebo will not be analysed (for exceptions, see Section 8.5.1.1).  The randomisation code will be supplied to the bioanalytics team before sample analysis. Results will only be reported for samples shipped within a timeframe for which the stability of capivasertib in the samples has been validated and shown to be acceptable. Samples may be collected at additional time points during the study if warranted and agreed upon between the investigator and the sponsor (eg, for safety reasons).  Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided by the sponsor or analytical test site.  The actual date and time (24-hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded.  The timing of sampling may be altered during the course of the study based on newly available data (eg, to obtain data closer to the time of peak or trough matrix concentrations) to ensure appropriate monitoring. Samples collected for analysis of capivasertib plasma concentrations may also be used to evaluate safety or efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or after the study. Samples will be collected, labelled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual. 8.5.1.1  Determination of Drug Concentration Samples for determination of capivasertib concentration in plasma will be assayed by bioanalytical test sites operated by or on behalf of Clinical Bioanalysis Alliance, AstraZeneca, using an appropriately validated bioanalytical method.  Full details of the analytical method used will be described in a separate bioanalytical report. For each participant in the placebo arm, samples will only be analysed on a \u2018for cause' basis, eg, if no quantifiable concentrations were observed in a participant's samples when the drug was expected to be present. Drug concentration information that may unblind the study will not be reported to investigative sites or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded. Incurred sample reproducibility analysis, if any, will be performed alongside the bioanalysis of the test samples.  The results from the evaluation, if performed, will be reported in a separate Bioanalytical Report. Additional analyses may be conducted on the biological samples to further investigate the presence and\/or identity of drug metabolites.  Any results from such analyses may be reported separately from the CSR. 8.5.2  Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics will not form part of this study. 8.6  Human Biological Sample Biomarkers 8.6.1  Collection of Mandatory Samples for Biomarker Analysis By consenting to participate in the study the subject consents to participate in the mandatory research components of the study. Samples for biomarker research are required and will be collected from all participants in this study as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). Mandatory Tumour Samples Tumour tissue samples from either the primary or metastatic sites (excluding bone metastases and FNA samples), taken as part of routine clinical practice, will be provided for assessment of PTEN status by IHC.  Determination of PTEN status is a requirement for recruitment and only patients with PTEN deficiency as detected by central testing using the Investigational Use Only (IUO) PTEN IHC assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, USA) will be enrolled.  This sample needs to be provided for screening Part 1, and should preferably be a representative FFPE tissue block, that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides, or if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides from the most recently collected tumour tissue.  Further details on tissue specifications are outlined in the Laboratory Manual and the Pathology Testing Manual.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1. In addition to being used for determination of eligibility for this study, the PTEN IHC results are also planned to be used for companion diagnostic test development.  Based on availability of tissue, additional diagnostic test development may be conducted and\/or further additional exploratory biomarkers may be evaluated, which may include but are not limited to, genomic analysis of tumour tissue to identify markers of response and resistance to study drugs.  For this purpose, an optional tumour sample (FFPE block [preferred] or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections) can be provided in screening Part 1.  For screening Part 2, eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) will be required to provide an additional tumour sample (FFPE block [preferred] or 20 [minimum 15] freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  Participants who provided optional additional tumour tissue in screening Part 1 are exempt from providing tumour in screening Part 2.  If fewer slides are available, the patient may still be eligible for the study, after discussion with and approval by the Medical Monitor.  Further details on tissue specifications are outlined in the Laboratory Manual.  China participants will not participate in these exploratory analyses. Mandatory Blood Samples for Exploratory Biomarker Analysis Blood samples will be collected for analysis of ctDNA (see Section 1.3).  The ctDNA samples collected at screening will be analysed for predictive biomarkers of response to treatment and may be used to develop and validate future in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests.  Several ctDNA samples will be taken during treatment and a final sample will be taken at disease progression.  These samples will be used for additional exploratory research which may include but is not limited to interrogation of changes in genetic alterations and potential mechanisms of resistance to treatment. For exploratory biomarker research, blood samples will be collected to provide plasma for circulating soluble factors and whole blood samples will be collected for DNA and RNA biomarkers.  These samples will be taken at multiple timepoints and analysed for a range of oncology and immunological biomarkers that may correlate with drug response.  These biomarkers may include, but are not limited to, panels of cytokines, chemokines and other soluble biomarkers; T-cell receptor repertoire analysis and analysis of gene expression biomarkers associated with immunomodulatory effects. Blood samples for the enumeration of CTCs using CellSearch assay will be collected at baseline, pre-treatment on Cycle 4\/Day 1, and at disease progression.  Blood samples will also be collected at Cycle 1\/Day 1 and on progression for the analysis of biomarkers detectable in CTCs using Epic Sciences assays. Details of sample collection, processing, shipping and storage are detailed in the Laboratory Manual. Blood samples for ctDNA testing, exploratory biomarker research, and CTC testing will not be collected from participants in China. 8.6.2  Collection of Optional Biomarker Samples Participants will sign an informed consent for the optional tumour tissue biopsies. Where possible, every effort should be made to collect optional samples for biomarker research from consenting patients in the study, as outlined in the SoA (see Section 1.3) and as follows: Paired biopsies: a baseline biopsy taken before the initial dosing of study drug at screening or pre-dose on Cycle 1, Day 1, and a biopsy taken on-treatment.  The on-treatment biopsy should be taken at least 4 hours post-dose between Cycle 1, Day 16 and Cycle 1, Day 18.  Biopsies should preferably be collected from the same tumour site.  The exact day, time and site of biopsy collection should be clearly noted in the associated documentation. An additional biopsy obtained at termination of treatment\/disease progression, if applicable. The tumour biopsy procedure will be performed by core needle, under radiological guidance, or surgically if the site of disease is superficial and palpable or visible.  It is mandated that the core biopsy be removed directly from the tumour in situ and not cored from a surgically removed tumour.  This is to ensure the best possible quality of the biopsy, so the blood\/nutrient supply to the tumour is not disrupted prior to biopsy collection.  Collection of tumour cells from fluid such as ascites or pleural effusion is not permitted.  The tumour samples may be analysed for biomarkers including, but not limited to, markers of PI3K\/AKT and AR pathways and treatment-induced changes in immunological markers such as CD8 expressing T-cells and PD-L1 expression. Collection of optional biomarker samples is not applicable for participants in China. 8.6.3  Other Study-related Biomarker Research Already collected samples may be analysed on different biomarkers thought to play a role in prostate cancer including, but not limited to, analysis of tumour tissue and peripheral blood samples for immunological biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression, TCR sequencing and gene expression analysis; chemokines and cytokines, and analysis of genes associated with AKT\/AR signalling in tumour tissue and ctDNA to evaluate their association with observed clinical responses to study drug.  For storage, re-use and destruction of biomarker samples see Section 8.5. 8.7  Optional Genomics Initiative Sample Collection of optional samples for genomics initiative research is also part of this study as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3) and is subject to agreement in the ICF addendum. A 6 mL blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected from participants who have consented to participate in the genetic analysis component of the study.  Participation is optional.  Participants who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the study. Note: Samples for genomics initiative research will not be collected for participants in China. See Appendix J for information regarding the Genomics Initiative genetic sample, including storage and destruction of genetic samples. 8.8  Medical Resource Utilisation and Health Economics The impact of treatment and disease on healthcare resource use will be captured in this study on an event-driven basis. The Hospital Admission (HOSPAD) module will be used to collect information on key health care resource use beyond study-mandated visits.  The site should complete the HOSPAD form at the site at every scheduled clinic visit up to and including the post study treatment discontinuation follow-up visit.  If a participant discontinues study treatment for reasons other than RECIST or PCWG3 progression, the HOSPAD form should continue to be administered until progression has been confirmed.  Study-mandated visits should not be included as a hospital admission. The data may be used as input to cost analyses for example cost utility analysis or cost effectiveness analysis. 9  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 9.1  Statistical Hypotheses The null hypothesis for the primary time-to-event endpoint rPFS, defined as the time from randomisation until the date of objective disease progression (adopting RECIST 1.1 criteria for soft tissue lesions and PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions) or death (from any cause in the absence of progression), is that there is no difference in event rate between capivasertib + abiraterone and placebo + abiraterone.  The intention of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of capivasertib + abiraterone over placebo + abiraterone. 9.2  Sample Size Determination Assuming a true treatment effect HR of 0.70 (this translates to an approximate 18-month improvement in median rPFS over an assumed 43-month median rPFS on abiraterone, assuming rPFS is exponentially distributed), approximately 331 rPFS events must be observed for the study to have 90% power to show a statistically significant difference in rPFS at the 2-sided 5% level, allowing for an interim analysis for efficacy.  The smallest treatment difference that would be statistically significant with 331 events is an rPFS HR of 0.806. Assuming 33% maturity (with maturity defined as the proportion of patients having an event), 1000 participants must be randomised (in a 1:1 ratio).  To randomise approximately 1000 participants, it is expected that approximately 5500 participants will be screened. There will be an interim analysis of rPFS, once approximately 222 (22% maturity) rPFS events have been observed.  With 222 events, a significant result will be declared if the observed rPFS HR is 0.593 or better at this interim analysis with a 2-sided p-value < 0.0001 (approximate relative information fraction = 67%).  The interim analysis on rPFS will be incorporated into the MTP. If the null hypothesis (no rPFS benefit of capivasertib [+ abiraterone backbone] versus placebo [+ abiraterone backbone]) is not rejected, at the final analysis (DCO2), rPFS will be tested at \u03b1 = 0.05 (2-sided). The approximate timing of the interim analysis (DCO1), the occurrence of 222 events, is expected to be at 39 months from the date of First Subject In and the timing of the final analysis (DCO2), the occurrence of 331 events, is expected to be at 52 months from First Subject In.  This is based on exponentially distributed rPFS events times and non-uniform accrual of participants over the 30 months recruitment period. Table 12 summarises the significance level, number of events, critical value, and power at each analysis.

This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the most important endpoints, including the primary and secondary endpoints. 9.4.1  General Considerations Analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representative.  A comprehensive SAP will be developed and finalised before the interim database cut and will describe the participant populations to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data.  This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints.  Any deviations from this plan will be reported in the CSR. 9.4.2  Efficacy Efficacy analyses will be performed based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) (ITT). 9.4.2.1  Primary Endpoint Radiographic PFS is defined in Section 8.1.2.1 as the time from randomisation until the date of objective disease progression (adopting RECIST 1.1 criteria for soft tissue lesions and PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions) or death (from any cause in the absence of progression) together with details of censoring. The effect of capivasertib versus placebo will be tested using a log rank test stratified by the randomisation stratification factors.  If there are insufficient events per strata, some strata will be collapsed following rules that will be pre-specified in the SAP.  The stratification variables in the statistical modelling will be based on the values entered into IWRS at randomisation. From the stratified Cox proportional hazards model (ties = Efron) the HR (capivasertib + abiraterone vs placebo + abiraterone) together with its corresponding 95% CI (calculated using a profile likelihood approach) will be presented.  A HR less than 1 will favour capivasertib + abiraterone. Subgroup analyses will be conducted comparing rPFS between the treatment arms.  The purpose of the subgroup analyses is to assess the consistency of treatment effect across potential or expected prognostic factors. The subgroups defined by the stratification factors (Section 4.1) will be analysed for rPFS. Additional subgroups of interest and analysis methods will be outlined in the SAP. No adjustment to the significance level for testing of subgroups will be made, since all of these subgroup analyses will be considered exploratory and may only be supportive of the primary analysis of PFS. A sensitivity analysis of rPFS as assessed by BICR assessment will also be conducted.  Further sensitivity analyses will be described in the SAP. 9.4.2.2  Key Secondary Endpoints Overall Survival Overall survival is defined in Section 8.1.3 together with details of censoring. Overall survival will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1), including subgroup analyses, and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. TFST TFST is defined in Section 8.1.5 together with details of censoring. TFST will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1) and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. SSE-FS SSE-FS is defined in Section 8.1.6 together with details of censoring. SSE-FS will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1) and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. Time to Pain Progression Time to pain progression (TTPP) is defined in Section 8.1.8.1.  TTPP will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1) and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. 9.4.2.3  Other Secondary Endpoints Time to PSA progression Time to PSA progression is defined in Section 8.1.4 together with details of censoring. Time to PSA progression will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1), and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% confidence interval will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. Time to Castration Resistance TTCR is defined in Section 8.1.7 together with details of censoring. TTCR will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1) and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. PFS2 PFS2 is defined in Section 8.1.2.5 together with details of censoring. PFS2 in the overall population will be analysed as described for the investigator-assessed rPFS endpoint (Section 9.4.2.1) and stratified by the randomisation stratification factors in accordance with the pooling strategy described in Section 9.4.2.1.  The HR and 95% CI will be based on the Cox proportional hazards model and the p-value on the stratified log rank test. Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Analysis details will be defined in the SAP. Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) Analysis details will be defined in the SAP. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate Cancer (FACT-P) Analysis details will be defined in the SAP. 9.4.2.4  Exploratory Endpoints Analyses of the following exploratory endpoints will be detailed in the SAP: Time to First Subsequent Chemotherapy, ORR, duration of response, PRO-CTCAE, and EQ-5D. 9.4.3  Safety Safety and tolerability will be assessed in terms of AEs and SAEs, physical examination findings, vital signs (including DBP\/SBP and pulse rate), ECG findings, and laboratory test results (including clinical chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis parameters).  These will be collected for all participants. Adverse events will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) that will have been released for execution at AstraZeneca\/designee. Safety data will be presented using descriptive statistics unless otherwise specified. Adverse events will be presented for each treatment group by system organ class and preferred term, covering number and percentage of participants reporting at least one event and number of events where appropriate. AEs occurring prior to start of Investigational Product, treatment-emergent AEs, and post-treatment AEs will be presented separately. An overview of AEs will present for each treatment group the number and percentage of participants with any AE, AEs with outcome of death, serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of Investigational Product, as well as AEs leading to Investigational Product dose interruptions and AEs leading to Investigational Product dose reductions. Separate AE tables will be provided taken into consideration relationship as assessed by the investigator, CTCAE grade, seriousness, death and events leading to discontinuation of Investigational Product as well as other action taken related to Investigational Product, events of special interest and other significant adverse events. An additional table will present the number and percentage of participants with the most common AEs. In accordance with the requirements of the FDA, a separate table will present non-serious AEs occurring in more than 5% of participants in any treatment group. Key participant information will be presented for participants with AEs with outcome of death, serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of investigational product. An AE listing for the safety analysis set will cover details for each individual AE. Full details of AE analyses will be provided in the SAP. The following events are considered treatment emergent: AEs with onset date on or after first dose of IMP (ie, capivasertib, placebo, abiraterone) Worsening of pre-existing events on or after first dose of IMP Other safety data including physical examinations, clinical haematology, chemistry, urinalysis, vital signs and ECGs will be summarised using descriptive statistics. 9.4.4  Other Analyses The plasma concentration-time data of capivasertib in combination with abiraterone will be analysed by population PK methods using non-linear mixed-effects modelling.  PK parameters, including variability parameters, will be estimated as data permits.  The influence of intrinsic (eg, ethnicity, gender, age, weight, renal function, and hepatic function) and extrinsic (eg, concomitant medication) factors will be evaluated and exposure-response relationships will be explored.  Details will be outlined in a separate modelling analysis plan and results may be reported separately. PK analyses will be performed based on the PK Analysis Set and any exclusion of data will be documented and justified. Data from this study may be pooled with data from other studies. 9.4.5  Methods for Multiplicity Control In order to preserve the overall type 1 error, the key secondary endpoints of OS, TFST, SSE-FS, and time to pain progression will be tested following a MTP (Figure 3).  Each endpoint will have its own spending function.  Other than for rPFS, the alpha allocation for the secondary endpoints will be controlled at the interim and\/or the final analysis timepoints by using the Lan-DeMets spending function (Lan and DeMets 1983) that approximates the O'Brien-Fleming approach, where the significance level applied at the interim analysis depends upon the proportion of information (ie, information fraction) available.  Each endpoint will be tested according to the group-sequential Holm variable (GSHv) procedure (Ye et al 2013). The MTP will be detailed in the SAP."

The SAP will describe the planned interim analyses in greater detail. 9.6  Data Monitoring Committee An IDMC will be established to assess the safety of capivasertib in an unblinded manner.  The IDMC will be responsible for reviewing the safety data accruing in the study at regular intervals, and the interim efficacy analysis to provide a recommendation to AstraZeneca whether the study should continue unchanged, be stopped, or be modified in any way.  The IDMC will consist of at least 2 physicians with expertise in prostate cancer and one biostatistician.  Further information on the IDMC and schedule of meetings will be defined in the IDMC Charter. 10  SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  Appendix A  ECOG\/WHO Performance Status The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)\/World Health Organization (WHO) performance status scale is presented in Table 14.

Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB\/IEC and applicable Regulatory Authority approval before implementation of changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study participants. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation.  The sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs\/IECs, and investigators. For all studies except those utilising medical devices investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB\/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. B 2  Financial Disclosure Investigators and sub-investigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information as requested to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities.  Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study. B 3  Informed Consent Process The investigator or his\/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the participant or their legally authorised representative and answer all questions regarding the study. Participants must be informed that their participation is voluntary, and they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason during the study.  Participants or their legally authorised representative will be required to sign a statement of informed consent that meets the requirements of 21 CFR 50, local regulations, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements, where applicable, and the IRB\/IEC or study centre, as well as any locally required privacy act document prior to performing any protocol-specific procedures including screening(s) and baseline evaluations.  A 2-stage process applies in this study and two ICFs are obtained according to the Schedule of Assessments (Section 1.3). The medical record must include a statement that written informed consent was obtained before any protocol-specific procedures were performed to the participant and the date the written consent was obtained.  The authorised person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF(s). Participants must be re-consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their participation in the study. A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the participant or the participant's legally authorised representative. If a participant declines to participate in any voluntary exploratory genetic research component of the study, there will be no penalty or loss of benefit to the participant and they will not be excluded from other aspects of the study. A participant who is rescreened is required to sign another ICF (relevant to the part the participant was consented to). The ICF will contain a separate section that addresses the use of remaining mandatory samples for optional exploratory research.  The investigator or authorised designee will explain to each participant the objectives of the exploratory research.  Participants will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason during the storage period.  The participant will give a separate agreement to allow any remaining specimens to be used for exploratory research.  Participants who decline to participate in this optional research will indicate this in the ICF. If a participant withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will be disposed of\/destroyed, and the action documented.  If samples already have been analysed at the time of the request, AstraZeneca will not be obliged to destroy the results of this research. B 4  Data Protection Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor.  Any participant records or datasets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names or any information which would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred. The participant must be informed that their personal study-related data will be used by the sponsor in accordance with local data protection law.  The level of disclosure and use of their data must also be explained to the participant in the informed consent The participant must be informed that their medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authorised personnel appointed by the sponsor, by appropriate IRB\/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities. B 5  Committees Structure The IDMC will be responsible for reviewing the unblinded safety data accruing in the study at regular intervals, and for reviewing the efficacy interim analysis.  The IDMC will consist of at least 2 physicians with expertise in prostate cancer and one biostatistician, and will be formed prior to the randomisation of the first participant.  Details will be described in the IDMC Charter. The composition of the study Steering Committee will be described in a Charter. B 6  Dissemination of Clinical Study Data A description of this clinical study will be available on http:\/\/astrazenecaclinicaltrials.com and http:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov as will the summary of the Study D361BC00001 results when they are available.  The clinical trial and\/or summary of Study D361BC00001 results may also be available on other websites according to the regulations of the countries in which Study D361BC00001 is conducted. B 7  Data Quality Assurance All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on eCRF unless transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data).  The investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or electronically signing the eCRF. The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the information entered in the eCRF. The investigator must permit study-related monitoring, audits, IRB\/IEC review, and regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. Monitoring details describing strategy (eg, risk-based initiatives in operations and quality such as Risk Management and Mitigation Strategies and Analytical Risk-Based Monitoring), methods, responsibilities and requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on-site monitoring) are provided in the Monitoring Plan. The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including quality checking of the data. The sponsor assumes accountability for actions delegated to other individuals (eg, Contract Research Organisations). Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the eCRF by authorised site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained by the investigator in accordance with local regulations unless institutional policies require a longer retention period.  No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the sponsor.  No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the sponsor. B 8  Source Documents Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the integrity of the data collected.  Source documents are filed at the investigator's site. Data reported on the eCRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained.  The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study.  Also, current medical records must be available. B 9  Study and Site Start and Closure The study start date is the date on which the clinical study will be open for recruitment of participants.  The first act of recruitment is the date of first participant enrolment and will be the study start date. The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor.  Study sites will be closed upon study completion.  A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study-site closure visit has been performed.  The investigator may initiate study-site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are not limited to: Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB\/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator Discontinuation of further study intervention development If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the investigators, the IECs\/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any contract research organisation(s) used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements.  The investigator shall promptly inform the participant and should assure appropriate participant therapy and\/or follow-up. Participants from terminated sites will have the opportunity to be transferred to another site to continue the study. B 10  Publication Policy The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings.  If this is foreseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor before submission.  This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments. The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results.  In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally support publication of multicentre studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data.  In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement. Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements. Appendix C  Guidance Regarding Potential Interactions of Capivasertib with Concomitant Medications C 1  Drugs that May Influence Capivasertib Pharmacokinetics Based on results from in vitro studies, capivasertib is a substrate of CYP3A4, although data suggests that glucuronidation may be the major metabolic route.  Co-administration of some CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase exposure to capivasertib and hence potentially affect toxicity, while CYP3A4 inducers may decrease the exposure to capivasertib and may potentially affect efficacy. The following lists (Table 15) are not intended to be exhaustive and a similar restriction will apply to other agents that are known to modulate CYP3A4 activity.  Appropriate medical judgment is required.  Please contact AstraZeneca with any queries you have on this issue.

C 2  Drugs That May be Influenced by Capivasertib There are currently no data confirming that there are any PK interactions between capivasertib and CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C9 substrates.  Likewise, there are no confirmed interactions with MATE1 or OCT2 substrates.  The potential interactions detailed in Table 16 and Table 17 are considered on the basis of preclinical data and physiologically-based PK (PBPK) modelling.  The following list is not intended to be exhaustive, and a similar restriction will apply to other agents that are known to be sensitive to inhibition of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and\/or CYP2C9 metabolism and\/or MATE1 or OCT2 transport and have a narrow therapeutic window.

Please refer to full prescribing information for all drugs prior to co-administration with capivasertib. C 3  Guidance for Statins Atorvastatin, cerivastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin should be avoided due to the potential for increased exposure through inhibition of CYP3A4 by capivasertib (Table 16). Fluvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin are minimally influenced by CYP3A4 inhibitors, conveying a relatively low potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions via this mechanism. Capivasertib also has a potential to inhibit the organic-anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP-1B1) transporter, which is implicated in the distribution and clearance of many of the statins.  The predicted increase in the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) is 1.3-fold for pravastatin and 1.5-fold for rosuvastatin.  It is, therefore, recommended that doses of pravastatin be capped to 40 mg once daily and rosuvastatin be capped to 10 mg once daily when combined with capivasertib, including 1 week prior to capivasertib administration and for 1 week following discontinuation of capivasertib. In summary, rosuvastatin (up to 10 mg once daily), pravastatin (up to 40 mg once daily) and fluvastatin are appropriate agents to be used in participants included in capivasertib studies who require statin therapy. C 4  Additional Resources For additional inhibitors, inducers and substrates please refer to: https:\/\/drug-interactions.medicine.iu.edu\/Clinical-Table.aspx https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/Drugs\/DevelopmentApprovalProcess\/DevelopmentResources\/DrugIntera ctionsLabeling\/ucm093664.htm Appendix D  Highly Effective Methods of Contraception Male participants should use barrier contraception (ie, condoms) from the time of screening until 16 weeks after discontinuation of capivasertib\/placebo.  Female partners of male participants should also use a highly effective form of contraception if they are of childbearing potential. Highly effective methods of contraception include: Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, intravaginal, or transdermal, Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: oral, injectable, or implantable, Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), Bilateral tubal occlusion, Male partner sterilisation (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate), True abstinence (ie, not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of study treatment and the treatment washout period is an acceptable practice; however, periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control). Acceptable method of contraception: Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical\/vault caps) with spermicidal foam\/gel\/film\/cream\/suppository. It is not known whether capivasertib has the capacity to affect the metabolism of hormonal contraceptives, so hormonal contraception should also be combined with a barrier method of contraception. Appendix E  Guidelines for Evaluation of Objective Tumour Response Using RECIST 1.1 Criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) in Soft Tissue and PCWG3 (Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3) in Bone Lesions E 1  INTRODUCTION This appendix details the implementation of RECIST 1.1 Guidelines (Eisenhauer et al 2009) and PCWG 3 guidelines (Scher et al 2016) for Study D361BC00001 with regards to assessment of tumour burden including protocol-specific requirements for this study. E 2  ASSESSMENT OF SOFT TISSUE DISEASE USING RECIST 1.1 CRITERIA Definition of Measurable, Non-measurable, Target, and Non-target Lesions In this study, bone lesions, with the exception of lytic lesions with a soft tissue component, will not be included in the RECIST assessment, neither as target lesions (TL), non-target lesions (NTL), or new lesions.  Bone lesions will be followed-up using a modified version of the PCWG3 criteria and the guidelines for bone lesion assessments are defined in the bone lesion section of this appendix (Section E 3). Measurable: A lesion, not previously irradiated, that can be accurately measured at baseline as \u2265 10 mm in the longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis \u2265 15 mm) with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements. Non-measurable: All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with \u2265 10 to < 15 mm short axis at baseline*). Truly non-measurable lesions include the following: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural\/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses\/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable by CT or MRI. Previously irradiated lesions** * Nodes with < 10 mm short axis are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed as NTL. ** Localised post-radiation changes which affect lesion sizes may occur.  Therefore, lesions that have been previously irradiated will not be considered measurable and must be selected as NTL at baseline and followed up as part of the NTL assessment. Special Cases: Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability.  Blastic lesions are considered non-measurable. Cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for measurability from a radiological point of view, but if non-cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these should be selected as target lesions. Target Lesions: A maximum of 5 measurable lesions (with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ), representative of all lesions involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as TL at baseline. Non-Target Lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should be identified as NTL at baseline (except bone lesions, which will be assessed as defined in bone lesion section of this appendix [Section E 3]). Methods of Assessment The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterise each identified and recorded lesion at baseline and during follow-up visits. A summary of the methods to be used for RECIST assessment is provided below and those excluded from tumour assessments for this study are highlighted, with the rationale provided. Table 18  Summary of Methods of Assessment Target Lesions  Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions  Non-Target Lesions New Lesions  New Lesions CT (preferred)  CT (preferred) MRI  MRI CT (preferred)  CT (preferred) MRI  MRI X-ray, Chest X-ray  X-ray, Chest X-ray CT (preferred)  CT (preferred) MRI  MRI X-ray, Chest X-ray  X-ray, Chest X-ray FDG-PET  FDG-PET Target Lesions Non-Target Lesions New Lesions CT (preferred) MRI CT (preferred) MRI X-ray, Chest X-ray CT (preferred) MRI X-ray, Chest X-ray FDG-PET CT and MRI CT and MRI are generally considered to be the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure TL selected for response assessment and to assess NTL and identification of any new lesions. In Study D361BC00001, it is recommended that CT examinations of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be used to assess tumour burden at baseline and follow-up visits.  CT examination with intravenous (iv) contrast media administration is the preferred method.  MRI should be used where CT is not feasible or is medically contraindicated.  For brain lesion assessment, MRI is the preferred method. Every effort should be made to maintain the radiologic imaging modality used at baseline throughout subsequent assessments. Chest X-ray In Study D361BC00001, chest X-ray assessment will not be used for assessment of TL as they will be assessed by CT examination or MRI examination.  Chest X-ray can, however, be used to assess NTL and to identify the presence of new lesions. Ultrasound In Study D361BC00001, ultrasound examination will not be used for assessment of TL and NTL as it is not a reproducible method, does not provide an accurate assessment of tumour size and it is subjective and operator dependent.  Ultrasound examination can, however, be used to identify the presence of new lesions.  If new clinical symptoms occur and an ultrasound is performed, then new lesions should be confirmed by CT or MRI examination. Endoscopy and Laparoscopy In Study D361BC00001, endoscopy and laparoscopy will not be used for tumour assessments as they are not validated in the context of tumour assessment. Tumour Markers In Study D361BC00001, tumour markers will not be used for tumour response assessments as per RECIST 1.1. In this study, PSA levels are being collected for separate analysis; however, the results will not contribute to tumour response based on RECIST 1.1 assessment. Cytology and Histology In Study D361BC00001, histology and cytology will not be used for tumour response assessments as per RECIST 1.1 and tumour response assessments will be performed on radiological criteria only. FDG-PET Scan In Study D361BC00001 FDG-PET scans may be used as a method for identifying new lesions, according with the following algorithm: New lesions will be recorded where there is positive FDG uptake* not present on baseline FDG-PET scan or in a location corresponding to a new lesion on CT\/MRI at the same follow-up visit.  If there is no baseline FDG-PET scan available, and no evidence of new lesions on CT\/MRI scans then follow-up CT\/MRI assessments should be continued, scheduled as per protocol or clinically indicated, in order to confirm new lesions. * A positive FDG-PET scan lesion should be reported only when an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue is observed. Tumour Response Evaluation Schedule of Evaluation Baseline assessments should encompass all areas of known predilection for metastases in the disease under evaluation and should additionally investigate areas that may be involved based on signs and symptoms of individual participants and should be performed no more than 28 days before the start of study treatment.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) after randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) or modified PCWG3 (bone).  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be adequately imaged at follow-up. If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their originally scheduled visits.  This schedule is to be followed in order to minimise any unintentional bias caused by some participants being assessed at a different frequency than other participants. Target Lesions (TL) Documentation of Target Lesions A maximum of 5 measurable lesions, with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ (including lymph nodes), representative of all lesions involved should be identified as TL at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (longest diameter for non-nodal lesions or short axis for nodal lesions), but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected. The site and location of each TL should be documented as well as the longest diameter for non-nodal lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes).  All measurements should be recorded in millimetres.  At baseline the sum of the diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters.  At follow-up visits the sum of diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as the follow-up sum of diameters. Special Cases: For TL measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the longest diameter.  For pathological lymph nodes measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the short axis. If the CT\/MRI slice thickness used is > 5 mm, the minimum size of measurable disease at baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan. If a lesion has completely disappeared, the longest diameter should be recorded as 0 mm. If a TL splits into 2 or more parts, then record the sum of the diameters of those parts. If 2 or more TL merge, then the sum of the diameters of the combined lesion should be recorded for 1 of the lesions and 0 mm recorded for the other lesion(s). If a TL is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned.  If an accurate measure can be given, this should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm. If a TL cannot be measured accurately due to it being too large, provide an estimate of the size of the lesion. When a TL has had any intervention eg, radiotherapy, embolisation, surgery etc., during the study, the size of the TL should still be provided where possible. Evaluation of Target Lesions This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumour visit response for TL.

Non-Target Lesions (NTL) Evaluation of Non-target Lesions All other lesions (or sites of disease), except for bone lesions, not recorded as TL should be identified as NTL at baseline.  Measurements are not required for these lesions, but their status should be followed at subsequent visits.  At each visit an overall assessment of the NTL response should be recorded by the investigator.  This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine and record overall response for NTL at the investigational site at each visit.

Not Applicable If the participant had no NTL at baseline. To achieve \u2018unequivocal progression' on the basis of NTL, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest \u2018increase' in the size of 1 or more NTL is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. New Lesions Details of any new soft tissue lesions will also be recorded with the date of assessment.  The presence of 1 or more new lesions is assessed as progression. A lesion identified at a follow up assessment in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumour. If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumour assessments should be continued until the new lesion has been confirmed.  If repeat scans confirm there is a new lesion, then the progression date should be declared using the date of the initial scan. Evaluation of Overall Visit Soft Tissue Response The overall visit response will be derived using the algorithm shown in Table 21.

E 3  ASSESSMENT OF BONE LESION PROGRESSION USING PCWG3 CRITERIA A modified version of PCWG3 will be used in this study.  The deviation from the PCWG3 guideline is that for all visits after the first scan post-baseline; no confirmatory scan is requested to assess PD.  Bone lesions will be assessed by bone scan and will not be part of the RECIST v1.1 malignant soft tissue assessment. Method of Assessment Bone lesions identified on a whole-body isotopic bone scan at baseline should be recorded and followed by the same method as per baseline assessment. In Study D361BC00001, isotopic bone scans will be used as a method of assessment to identify the presence of new bone lesions at follow-up visits.  New lesions will be recorded where a positive and unequivocal hot-spot that was not present on the baseline bone scan assessment is identified on a bone scan performed at any time during the study.  The investigator should consider the positive hot-spot to be a significant new site of malignant disease and represent true disease progression in order to record the new lesion. Tumour Progression Evaluation Schedule of the Evaluation Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before the start of study treatment.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (\u00b1 14 days) after randomisation until objective disease progression assessed by investigator as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) or PCWG3 (bone). If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their originally scheduled visits.  This schedule is to be followed in order to minimise any unintentional bias caused by some participants being assessed at a different frequency than other participants. Documentation of Lesions All bone lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified at baseline.  Their status should be followed at subsequent visits.  At each visit an overall assessment of the bone lesion progression should be recorded by the investigator.  This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine and record bone progression at the investigational site at each visit. Progression on a bone scan is identified using modified PCWG3 criteria, by having 2 or more new metastatic bone lesions: For patients without progression at the first visit after baseline, the scan from this first visit after baseline now serves as new reference for all subsequent scans, ie, assuming all visits are acquired according to schedule all bone scans after Week 16 are compared to the Week 16 scan. The requirements for determination and confirmation of radiographic progression by either bone scan (bone progression) or CT\/MRI (soft tissue progression) are summarised in Table 22.

It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. During the course of the study the investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry.  The investigator is responsible for determining whether a participant meets potential PHL criteria at any point during the study. All sources of laboratory data are appropriate for the determination of PHL and HL events; this includes samples taken at scheduled study visits and other visits including central and all local laboratory evaluations even if collected outside of the study visits; for example, PHL criteria could be met by an elevated ALT from a central laboratory and\/or elevated TBL from a local laboratory. The investigator will also review Adverse Event data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevations in liver biochemistry) for possible PHL events. The investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy's Law (HL) criteria are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP). The investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL\/HL cases and for reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events (AEs) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes. G 2  Definitions Potential Hy's Law (PHL) Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) \u2265 3x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) together with Total Bilirubin (TBL) \u2265 2xULN at any point during the study following the start of study medication irrespective of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP). Hy's Law (HL) AST or ALT \u2265 3x ULN together with TBL \u2265 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, can be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug. For PHL and HL the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur. G 3  Identification of Potential Hy's Law Cases In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any participant who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in combination: ALT \u2265 3xULN AST \u2265 3xULN TBL \u2265 2xULN The investigator will without delay review each new laboratory report and if the identification criteria are met will: Notify the AstraZeneca representative Determine whether the participant meets PHL criteria (see Section G 2 for definition) by reviewing laboratory reports from all previous visits Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory eCRF G 4  Follow-up G 4.1  Potential Hy's Law Criteria Not Met If the participant does not meet PHL criteria the investigator will: Inform the AstraZeneca representative that the participant has not met PHL criteria. Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance provided in the Clinical Study Protocol. G 4.2  Potential Hy's Law Criteria Met If the participant does meet PHL criteria the investigator will: Notify the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central Study Team. Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the investigator will report the case as an SAE of Potential Hy's Law; serious criteria \u2018Important medical event' and causality assessment \u2018yes\/related' according to CSP process for SAE reporting. For participants that met PHL criteria prior to starting IMP, the investigator is not required to submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change in the participant's condition. The Study Physician contacts the investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an approach for the study participants' follow-up (including any further laboratory testing) and the continuous review of data. Subsequent to this contact the investigator will: Monitor the participant until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated.  Completes follow-up SAE Form as required. Investigate the aetiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as discussed with the Study Physician. Complete the three Liver eCRF Modules as information becomes available. #A \u2018significant' change in the participant's condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, or total bilirubin) in isolation or in combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determination of whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the investigator, this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty. G 5  Review and Assessment of Potential Hy's Law Cases The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met. As soon as possible after the biochemistry abnormality was initially detected, the Study Physician contacts the investigator in order to review available data and agree on whether there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the IMP, to ensure timely analysis and reporting to health authorities within 15 calendar days from date PHL criteria was met.  The AstraZeneca Global Clinical Lead or equivalent and Global Safety Physician will also be involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as appropriate. According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the investigator will follow the instructions below. Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE: If the alternative explanation is not an AE, record the alternative explanation on the appropriate eCRF. If the alternative explanation is an AE\/SAE: update the previously submitted Potential Hy's Law SAE and AE eCRFs accordingly with the new information (reassessing event term; causality and seriousness criteria) following the AstraZeneca standard processes. If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL elevations other than the IMP: Send updated SAE (report term \u2018Hy's Law') according to AstraZeneca standard processes. The \u2018Medically Important' serious criterion should be used if no other serious criteria apply. As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of \u2018related' should be assigned. If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 15 calendar days in obtaining the information necessary to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made: Provides any further update to the previously submitted SAE of Potential Hy's Law, (report term now \u2018Hy's Law case') ensuring causality assessment is related to IMP and seriousness criteria is medically important, according to CSP process for SAE reporting. Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine whether HL criteria are still met.  Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report following CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review and amending the reported term if an alternative explanation for the liver biochemistry elevations is determined.

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a deterioration of a pre-existing medical occurrence.  An AE may occur at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no Study treatment has been administered. H 2  Definitions of Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run-in, treatment, washout, follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria: Results in death Is immediately life-threatening Requires in-participant hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the participant or may require medical treatment to prevent one of the outcomes listed above The above instruction applies only when the malignant tumour event in question is a new malignant tumour (ie, it is not the tumour for which entry into the study is a criterion and that is being treated by the IP under study and is not the development of new or progression of existing metastasis to the tumour under study).  Malignant tumours that - as part of normal, if rare, progression - undergo transformation (eg, Richter's transformation of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia into diffuse large B cell lymphoma) should not be considered a new malignant tumour. Life-threatening \u2018Life-threatening' means that the participant was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred, or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the participant's death.  \u2018Life-threatening' does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure). Hospitalisation Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospital admissions and\/or surgical operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the participant was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study. Important Medical Event or Medical Treatment Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situations where important medical events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death, hospitalisation, disability or incapacity but may jeopardise the participant or may require medical treatment to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.  These should usually be considered as serious. Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical judgement must be used. Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone treatment Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N-acetylcysteine Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation Development of drug dependency or drug abuse Intensity Rating Scale The grading scales found in the revised National Cancer Institute CTCAE latest version will be utilised for all events with an assigned CTCAE grading.  For those events without assigned CTCAE grades, the recommendation in the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, moderate and severe events into CTCAE grades should be used.  A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program website (http:\/\/ctep.cancer.gov).  The applicable version of CTCAE should be described clearly. It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Appendix H 2.  An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Appendix H 2.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix H 2. H 3  A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question When making an assessment of causality consider the following factors when deciding if there is a \u2018reasonable possibility' that an AE may have been caused by the drug. Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the participant actually received the suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug? Consistency with known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological properties? De-challenge experience.  Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect drug? No alternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors. Re-challenge experience.  Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge. Laboratory tests.  A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship. In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: Is this a recognised feature of overdose of the drug? Is there a known mechanism? Causality of \u2018related' is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a \u2018reasonable possibility' of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expression \u2018reasonable possibility' of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough information to make an informed judgment.  With no available facts or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, the event(s) will be assessed as \u2018not related'. Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility. H 4  Medication Error For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study drug that either causes harm to the participant or has the potential to cause harm to the participant. A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or participant. Medication error includes situations where an error. occurred was identified and intercepted before the participant received the drug did not occur, but circumstances were recognised that could have led to an error Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors: Drug name confusion Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to the participant Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of administration Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet dissolved in water when it should be taken as a solid tablet Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature Wrong participant received the medication (excluding IWRS errors) Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IWRS errors) Examples of events that do not require reporting as medication errors in clinical studies: Errors related to or resulting from IWRS - including those which lead to one of the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error Participant accidentally missed drug dose(s) eg, forgot to take medication Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose) Participant failed to return unused medication or empty packaging None Capivasertib (AZD5363) Errors related to background and rescue medication, or standard of care medication in open label studies, even if an AstraZeneca product Medication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the medication error.  Appendix I  Handling of Human Biological Samples I 1  Chain of Custody A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle. The investigator at each centre keeps full traceability of collected biological samples from the participants while in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate) and records relevant processing information related to the samples whilst at site. The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps record of receipt of arrival and onward shipment or disposal. AstraZeneca or delegated representatives will keep oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring of study sites, auditing or process checks, and contractual requirements of external laboratory providers. Samples retained for further use will be stored in the AstraZeneca-assigned biobanks or other sample archive facilities and will be tracked by the appropriate AstraZeneca Team during for the remainder of the sample life cycle. If required, AstraZeneca will ensure that remaining biological samples are returned to the site according to local regulations or at the end of the retention period, whichever is the sooner. Procedures for biobanking samples as described above will be not applicable to China, and all residual sample from testing in China will be managed as per all applicable local regulations. I 2  Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Donated Biological Samples If a participant withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will be disposed of\/destroyed\/repatriated, and the action documented.  If samples are already analysed, AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy the results of this research. Following withdrawal of consent for biological samples, further study participation should be considered in relation to the withdrawal processes outlined in the informed consent. The investigator: Ensures participant's withdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is highlighted immediately to AstraZeneca or delegate. Ensures that relevant human biological samples from that participant, if stored at the study site, are immediately identified, disposed of as appropriate, and the action documented. Ensures that the participant and AstraZeneca are informed about the sample disposal. AstraZeneca ensures the organisation(s) holding the samples is\/are informed about the withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of or repatriated as appropriate, and the action documented and study site notified. I 3  International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) 6.2 Guidance Document LABELLING AND SHIPMENT OF BIOHAZARD SAMPLES International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) (https:\/\/www.iata.org\/whatwedo\/cargo\/dgr\/Pages\/download.aspx) classifies infectious substances into 3 categories: Category A, Category B or Exempt Category A Infectious Substances are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals. Category A pathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus.  Infectious substances meeting these criteria which cause disease in humans or both in humans and animals must be assigned to UN 2814.  Infectious substances which cause disease only in animals must be assigned to UN 2900: Category B Infectious Substances are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in Category A.  Category B pathogens are eg, Hepatitis A, C, D, and E viruses.  They are assigned the following UN number and proper shipping name UN 3373 - Biological Substance, Category B are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650 Exempt - Substances which do not contain infectious substances or substances which are unlikely to cause disease in humans or animals are not subject to these Regulations unless they meet the criteria for inclusion in another class. Clinical study samples will fall into Category B or exempt under IATA regulations Clinical study samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient temperature in IATA 650 compliant packaging (https:\/\/www.iata.org\/whatwedo\/cargo\/dgr\/Documents\/DGR-60-EN-PI650.pdf). Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods specification for the dry-ice content Appendix J  Optional Genomics Initiative Sample J 1  Use\/analysis of DNA AstraZeneca intends to collect and store DNA for genetic research to explore how genetic variations may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis of diseases, and the response to medications.  This genetic research may lead to better understanding of diseases, better diagnosis of diseases or other improvements in health care and to the discovery of new diagnostics, treatments or medications.  Therefore, where local regulations and IRB\/IEC allow, a blood sample will be collected for DNA analysis from consenting participants. This optional genetic research may consist of the analysis of the structure of the participant's DNA, ie, the entire genome. The results of genetic analyses may be reported in a separate study summary. The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality. The samples will be retained while research on capivasertib continues but no longer than 15 years or other period as per local requirements. J 2  Genetic Research Plan and Procedures Selection of Genetic Research Population All participants will be asked to participate in this genetic research, except for China participants.  Samples for genomics initiative research will not be collected for participants in China.  Participation is voluntary and if a participant declines to participate there will be no penalty or loss of benefit.  The participant will not be excluded from any aspect of the main study. Inclusion Criteria For inclusion in this genetic research, participants must fulfil all of the inclusion criteria described in the main body of the Clinical Study Protocol and: Provide informed consent for the Genomics Initiative sampling and analyses. Exclusion Criteria Exclusion from this genetic research may be for any of the exclusion criteria specified in the main study or any of the following: Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion in 120 days of genetic sample collection Withdrawal of Consent for Genetic Research Participants may withdraw from this genetic research at any time, independent of any decision concerning participation in other aspects of the main study.  Voluntary withdrawal will not prejudice further treatment.  Procedures for withdrawal are outlined in Section 7.2 of the main Clinical Study Protocol. Collection of Samples for Genetic Research A 6 mL blood sample for this genetic research will be obtained from the participants pre-dose on Cycle 1, Day 1, after randomisation.  Although DNA is stable, early sample collection is preferred to avoid introducing bias through excluding participants who may withdraw due to an adverse event (AE).  If for any reason the sample is not drawn at Cycle 1, Day 1, it may be taken at any visit until the last study visit.  Only one sample should be collected per participant for genetics during the study. Coding and Storage of DNA Samples The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genetic analysis are important to maintain participant confidentiality.  Samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years, from the date of last participant last visit, after which they will be destroyed.  DNA is a finite resource that is used up during analyses.  Samples will be stored and used until no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached. An additional second code will be assigned to the sample either before or at the time of DNA extraction replacing the information on the sample tube.  Thereafter, the sample will be identifiable only by the second, unique number.  This number is used to identify the sample and corresponding data at the AstraZeneca genetics laboratories, or at the designated organisation.  No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any person (AstraZeneca employee or designated organisations working with the DNA). The link between the participant enrolment\/randomisation code and the second number will be maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at AstraZeneca or designated organisations.  The link will be used to identify the relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitate correlation of genotypic results with clinical data, allow regulatory audit, and permit tracing of samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of consent. Ethical and Regulatory Requirements The principles for ethical and regulatory requirements for the study, including this genetics research component, are outlined in Appendix B. Informed Consent The genetic component of this study is optional and the participant may participate in other components of the main study without participating in this genetic component.  To participate in the genetic component of the study the participant must sign and date both the consent form for the main study and the addendum for the Genomics Initiative component of the study.  Copies of both signed and dated consent forms must be given to the participant and the original filed at the study centre.  The Principal investigator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is given freely and that the participant understands that they may freely withdrawal from the genetic aspect of the study at any time. Participant Data Protection AstraZeneca will not provide individual genotype results to participants, any insurance company, any employer, their family members, general physician unless required to do so by law. Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked to the identity of the participant.  In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a participant.  For example, in the case of a medical emergency, an AstraZeneca Physician or an investigator might know a participant's identity and also have access to his or her genetic data.  Regulatory authorities may require access to the relevant files, though the participant's medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate. Data Management Any genetic data generated in this study will be stored at a secure system at AstraZeneca and\/or designated organisations to analyse the samples. AstraZeneca and its designated organisations may share summary results (such as genetic differences from groups of individuals with a disease) from this genetic research with other researchers, such as hospitals, academic organisations, or health insurance companies.  This can be done by placing the results in scientific databases, where they can be combined with the results of similar studies to learn even more about health and disease.  The researchers can only use this information for health-related research purposes.  Researchers may see summary results, but they will not be able to see individual participant data or any personal identifiers. Some or all of the clinical datasets from the main study may be merged with the genetic data in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database.
