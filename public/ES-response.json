Type of Participant and Disease Characteristics *Histologically-confirmed de novo (ie, diagnosed within 3 months of randomisation) metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma.  Note: adenocarcinoma must be the primary histological pattern and patients with small-cell tumours are not eligible. *Consent to provide a FFPE tissue block (preferred) or slides.  Details on tissue requirements are specified in the Laboratory Manual.  Cytologic or FNA samples are not acceptable.  Tumour tissue from bone metastases is not acceptable. *A valid PTEN IHC result indicating PTEN deficiency (centralised testing). Metastatic disease documented prior to randomisation by clear evidence of ≥ 1 bone lesion (defined as 1 lesion with positive uptake on bone scan) and/or ≥ 1 soft tissue lesion (measurable and/or non-measurable) that can be accurately assessed at baseline and is suitable for repeated assessment with CT and/or MRI.  Patients with metastatic disease identified by PSMA PET only, will not be eligible.  Local lymph node involvement is not considered metastatic disease. Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic form of prostate cancer based on the investigator's clinical evaluation. *Candidate for abiraterone and steroid therapy.  Previous treatment with abiraterone and/or a steroid for de novo disease is allowed up to a maximum of 3 months prior to randomisation (prior treatment with chemotherapy or other NHAs is not allowed). Ongoing ADT with GnRH analogue (combination with first generation androgen receptor antagonists, eg, bicalutamide is allowed), or LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy.  Duration of ongoing ADT (regardless of method) is from 0 days to a maximum of 3 months prior to randomisation. ECOG/WHO performance status 0 to 1 (see Appendix A) with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks. *Able and willing to swallow and retain oral medication. Participants must complete the 7-day BPI-SF and BFI questionnaires and the analgesic diary during screening (only after PTEN deficiency is confirmed), prior to randomisation.  Note: it is required to give participants at least 7 consecutive days to complete the assessments prior to randomisation.  If a minimum of 4 assessments is not completed during the 7-day period, participants must be re-screened, a new 7 days of questionnaire/diary entries completed, and any screening tests which are consequently outside of the applicable 28 days prior to randomisation must also be repeated.  Sex *Participants will be male. Reproduction 13  Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm: Sterilisation (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). Participants should use barrier contraception (ie, condoms) from the time of screening until 16 weeks after discontinuation of study drug.  It is not known whether the pre-clinical changes seen in the male animal reproductive organs, after treatment with capivasertib, will be fully reversible or will permanently affect the ability to produce healthy sperm following treatment.  Therefore, if participants wish to father children, they should be advised to arrange for collection of sperm samples prior to the start of study treatment. Informed Consent *Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix B 3, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICF and in this CSP. Provision of signed and dated written Optional Genetic Research Information informed consent prior to collection of samples for optional genetic research that supports Genomic Initiative.",

          "AdverseEvents": "8.3  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The Principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix H. AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorised representative). The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE.  For information on how to follow up AEs see Section 8.3.2. 8.3.1  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information Adverse events, including SAEs, will be collected from time of signature of the ICF, throughout the treatment period and including the 30-day follow-up period after discontinuation of study drug.  * *In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs/SAEs must be reported. If the investigator becomes aware of a SAE with a suspected causal relationship to the IMP that occurs after the end of the clinical study in a participant treated by him or her, the investigator shall, without undue delay, report the SAE to the sponsor. 8.3.2  Follow-up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  All SAEs/non-serious AEs (as defined in Appendix H), will be followed until resolution, stabilisation, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up. A post-study assessment will be performed preferably within 7 days of the time that the IMP is permanently discontinued. Safety follow-up should be carried out with the participant 30 days (+ 7 days) after the discontinuation of study treatment to follow-up any SAEs/AEs and concomitant medications (including any subsequent cancer therapy). Any AE/SAE/abnormal laboratory findings that are ongoing at the time of study treatment discontinuation or any new treatment related events within 30 days of study treatment, must be followed up to resolution or until the event becomes stable (or returns to baseline) or is unlikely to resolve further in the opinion of the investigator. Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant's last AE assessment or other assessment/visit as appropriate in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF.  AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any participant with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 8.3.3  Adverse Event Variables The following variables will be collected for each AE: AE (verbatim) The date when the AE started and stopped CTCAE grade and changes in CTCAE grade Whether the AE is serious or not Investigator causality rating against the IMP(s) (yes or no) Action taken with regard to IMP(s) AE caused participant's withdrawal from study (yes or no) Outcome. In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: Date AE met criteria for serious AE Date investigator became aware of SAE AE is serious due to Date of hospitalisation Date of discharge Probable cause of death Date of death Autopsy performed Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) Causality assessment to other medication 8.3.4  Causality Collection The investigator should assess the causal relationship between the IMP and each AE, and answer ‘yes' or ‘no' to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?' For SAEs, causal relationship should also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes'. A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix H. 8.3.5  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the participant or reported in response to the open question from the study site staff (eg, ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?'), or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF.  When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 8.3.6  Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests The results from the CSP-mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG abnormalities should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria, are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product or are considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the investigator (which may include but not limited to consideration as to whether treatment or non-planned visits were required or other action was taken with the study treatment, eg, dose adjustment or drug interruption). If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally related to the disease under study (see Section 8.3.8). 8.3.7  Hy's Law Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3xULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN may need to be reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix G for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy's Law. 8.3.8  Disease Progression Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a participant's condition attributable to the disease for which the investigational product is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The development of new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events that are unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an AE during the study. 8.3.9  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational product, or to the study procedure(s)*.  All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. *In Screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting). If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately.  investigators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the EDC system, an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the EDC system is not available, then the investigator or other study site staff reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the investigator/study site staff how to proceed. For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix H. The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness for capivasertib is the current IB; for abiraterone, the local prescribing information is the reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness. 8.3.10  Pregnancy Paternal Exposure Participants should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 16 weeks following the last dose of capivasertib/placebo. Pregnancy of the participants' partners is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until 16 weeks after the last dose should, if possible, be followed up and documented. 8.3.11  Medication Error If a medication error occurs in the course of the study, then the investigator or other site personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is completed within 1 (Initial Fatal/Life-Threatening or follow up Fatal/Life-Threatening) or 5 (other serious initial and follow up) calendar days if there is an SAE associated with the medication error (see Section 8.3.9) and within 30 days for all other medication errors. The definition of a Medication Error can be found in Appendix H 4. 8.3.12  Management of Capivasertib-related Toxicities 8.3.12.1  Capivasertib/Placebo Dose Modification and Guidance Please refer to Section 6.6 for guidance on dose modifications. 8.3.12.2  Dose Modifications due to General Capivasertib-related Toxicities Treatment with capivasertib/placebo should be temporarily interrupted for any intolerable AE regardless of grade or for any AEs grade ≥ 3 that occurs despite optimal supportive care, are not attributable to the disease under investigation, where the investigator considers the AE of concern to be specifically associated with capivasertib.  Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related toxicities are shown in Table 8.  Appropriate and optimal treatment of the toxicity is assumed prior to considering dose modifications.  The Study Physician may be consulted prior to discontinuation of study drug due to toxicities.  Please see Section 8.3.12.3 for the management of capivasertib-specific toxicities including hyperglycaemia, maculo-papular rash and other skin reactions, and diarrhoea.

In participants who are diabetic, it may be beneficial to rule out concomitant aetiologies that could be associated with hyperglycaemia (eg, infections, dehydration, vascular events, glucocorticoids). Participants should be made aware of symptoms of hyperglycaemia (eg, polydipsia and polyuria). Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related hyperglycaemia are shown in Table 9.  In addition, for all grades, participants may receive education on lifestyle changes (eg, a diabetic diet) and consider beginning home glucose monitoring (eg, fasting self-blood glucose monitoring once daily) at the discretion of the investigator.  If glucose home monitoring is instituted, the capivasertib/placebo treatment decision should be based on the morning fasting glucose value obtained prior to the dose of capivasertib/placebo. It is recommended that approaches to the management of capivasertib-induced hyperglycaemia include advice from a diabetologist where appropriate (eg, participants with diabetes).  Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies (see below for further guidance).  If a second agent is required, consideration should be given to the intermittent schedule of capivasertib and the pattern of glucose changes (eg, sulphonylureas should be avoided due to the risk of hypoglycaemia secondary to their mechanism of action).

Treatment as per local guidelines, consider the use of oral antidiabetic (eg, metformin) on capivasertib/placebo dosing days [see further guidance on choice of antidiabetic agents on text above and below this table] Symptomatic: Appropriate clinical management as per local guidelines Interrupt capivasertib/placebo until resolution of symptoms and fasting blood glucose is ≤ 160 mg/dL or ≤ 8.9 mmol/L (treatment can be interrupted for up to 21 days). Restart at same dose level maintaining appropriate antidiabetic treatment (eg addition of/increased dose of oral metformin). Consider consult with the diabetologist Grade 3 (Insulin therapy initiated; hospitalisation indicated) Hold capivasertib up to 21 days, until resolution of symptoms.  Consult with diabetologist. If fasting blood glucose decreases to ≤ 160 mg/dL or ≤ 8.9 mmol/L within 21 days and under appropriate antidiabetic treatment, resume capivasertib/placebo at one lower dose level. If fasting blood glucose does not decrease to ≤ 160 mg/dL or ≤ 8.9 mmol/L within 21 days following appropriate antidiabetic treatment, permanently discontinue capivasertib/placebo. Grade 4 (Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated) Appropriate clinical management of hyperglycaemia as per local guidelines.  Consider consult with the diabetologist. Consider permanent cessation of capivasertib/placebo. Participants may receive education on lifestyle changes (eg, a diabetic diet) and consider beginning home glucose monitoring (eg, fasting SBGM once daily) at the discretion of the investigator.  If glucose home monitoring is instituted, the capivasertib/placebo treatment decision should be based on the morning fasting glucose value obtained prior to the dose of capivasertib/placebo. NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0; SBGM, self-blood glucose monitoring. Use of metformin Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies.  Investigators should exercise caution in the dosing and management of participants receiving the metformin and capivasertib/placebo combination and must be vigilant for signs of renal impairment and metformin toxicity, such as lactic acidosis and hypoglycaemia, namely: lethargy, hypotension, poor urine output, drowsiness, irritation, tachypnoea, sweating, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Due to the potential interaction of metformin and capivasertib (caused by the inhibition of renal transporters [eg, OCT2] involved in the excretion of metformin), when taking both capivasertib and metformin concurrently, participants should attend the clinic for monitoring of serum creatinine at least once per week for the first 3 weeks after initiation of metformin, then every 3 weeks thereafter. Metformin should only be given on the days when capivasertib/placebo is also administered (the half-life of capivasertib is approximately 7 to 15 hours) and should be withdrawn when treatment with capivasertib/placebo is withdrawn, unless otherwise clinically indicated. Consider withholding of metformin on the days when participants are due to have imaging with contrast (in order to reduce the already low risk of lactic acidosis) as per local guidelines. Maculo-papular Rash Dose modifications for capivasertib-related maculo-papular rash, which is the most frequent skin toxicity observed in participants treated with capivasertib, are provided in Table 10.  However, these management guidelines can be used for other skin toxicities at the discretion of the investigator and/or following consultation with the dermatologist.

BSA, body surface area; NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. Hypersensitivity In the case of hypersensitivity reactions, capivasertib/placebo should be discontinued, and symptomatic/supportive therapy should be initiated (including with antihistamines and/or steroids) as considered appropriate by the investigator/treating physician.  Drug re-challenge is not recommended; any subsequent consideration on re-challenge with capivasertib at the same or a lower dose, with its potential for recurrence of such or more severe events should be carefully considered against the potential benefits to the individual participant from continuation of capivasertib therapy and agreed with the sponsor.  Further management should follow local guidelines on management of hypersensitivity reactions. Diarrhoea Participants should be instructed to promptly contact investigators if they develop diarrhoea. Alternative aetiologies should be ruled out prior to initiating the dose modifications.  Investigators are recommended to prescribe anti-diarrhoeal treatment at the first visit so that participants can start treatment at the first sign of diarrhoea, should it occur.  Loperamide is the preferred anti-diarrhoeal agent for the management of diarrhoea occurring in participants participating in studies of capivasertib.  If diarrhoea is reported, additional details regarding this AE will be collected in the eCRF. Dose modifications for capivasertib-related diarrhoea are provided in Table 11.

          "SeriousAdverseEvents": "8.3  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The Principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix H. AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorised representative). The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE.  For information on how to follow up AEs see Section 8.3.2. 8.3.1  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information Adverse events, including SAEs, will be collected from time of signature of the ICF, throughout the treatment period and including the 30-day follow-up period after discontinuation of study drug.  * *In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs/SAEs must be reported. If the investigator becomes aware of a SAE with a suspected causal relationship to the IMP that occurs after the end of the clinical study in a participant treated by him or her, the investigator shall, without undue delay, report the SAE to the sponsor. 8.3.2  Follow-up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  All SAEs/non-serious AEs (as defined in Appendix H), will be followed until resolution, stabilisation, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up. A post-study assessment will be performed preferably within 7 days of the time that the IMP is permanently discontinued. Safety follow-up should be carried out with the participant 30 days (+ 7 days) after the discontinuation of study treatment to follow-up any SAEs/AEs and concomitant medications (including any subsequent cancer therapy). Any AE/SAE/abnormal laboratory findings that are ongoing at the time of study treatment discontinuation or any new treatment related events within 30 days of study treatment, must be followed up to resolution or until the event becomes stable (or returns to baseline) or is unlikely to resolve further in the opinion of the investigator. Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant's last AE assessment or other assessment/visit as appropriate in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF.  AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any participant with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 8.3.3  Adverse Event Variables The following variables will be collected for each AE: AE (verbatim) The date when the AE started and stopped CTCAE grade and changes in CTCAE grade Whether the AE is serious or not Investigator causality rating against the IMP(s) (yes or no) Action taken with regard to IMP(s) AE caused participant's withdrawal from study (yes or no) Outcome. In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: Date AE met criteria for serious AE Date investigator became aware of SAE AE is serious due to Date of hospitalisation Date of discharge Probable cause of death Date of death Autopsy performed Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) Causality assessment to other medication 8.3.4  Causality Collection The investigator should assess the causal relationship between the IMP and each AE, and answer ‘yes' or ‘no' to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?' For SAEs, causal relationship should also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes'. A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix H. 8.3.5  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the participant or reported in response to the open question from the study site staff (eg, ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?'), or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF.  When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 8.3.6  Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests The results from the CSP-mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG abnormalities should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria, are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product or are considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the investigator (which may include but not limited to consideration as to whether treatment or non-planned visits were required or other action was taken with the study treatment, eg, dose adjustment or drug interruption). If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally related to the disease under study (see Section 8.3.8). 8.3.7  Hy's Law Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3xULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN may need to be reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix G for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy's Law. 8.3.8  Disease Progression Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a participant's condition attributable to the disease for which the investigational product is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The development of new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events that are unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an AE during the study. 8.3.9  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational product, or to the study procedure(s)*.  All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. *In Screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting). If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately.  investigators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the EDC system, an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the EDC system is not available, then the investigator or other study site staff reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the investigator/study site staff how to proceed. For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix H. The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness for capivasertib is the current IB; for abiraterone, the local prescribing information is the reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness. 8.3.10  Pregnancy Paternal Exposure Participants should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 16 weeks following the last dose of capivasertib/placebo. Pregnancy of the participants' partners is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until 16 weeks after the last dose should, if possible, be followed up and documented. 8.3.11  Medication Error If a medication error occurs in the course of the study, then the investigator or other site personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is completed within 1 (Initial Fatal/Life-Threatening or follow up Fatal/Life-Threatening) or 5 (other serious initial and follow up) calendar days if there is an SAE associated with the medication error (see Section 8.3.9) and within 30 days for all other medication errors. The definition of a Medication Error can be found in Appendix H 4. 8.3.12  Management of Capivasertib-related Toxicities 8.3.12.1  Capivasertib/Placebo Dose Modification and Guidance Please refer to Section 6.6 for guidance on dose modifications. 8.3.12.2  Dose Modifications due to General Capivasertib-related Toxicities Treatment with capivasertib/placebo should be temporarily interrupted for any intolerable AE regardless of grade or for any AEs grade ≥ 3 that occurs despite optimal supportive care, are not attributable to the disease under investigation, where the investigator considers the AE of concern to be specifically associated with capivasertib.  Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related toxicities are shown in Table 8.  Appropriate and optimal treatment of the toxicity is assumed prior to considering dose modifications.  The Study Physician may be consulted prior to discontinuation of study drug due to toxicities.  Please see Section 8.3.12.3 for the management of capivasertib-specific toxicities including hyperglycaemia, maculo-papular rash and other skin reactions, and diarrhoea.

In participants who are diabetic, it may be beneficial to rule out concomitant aetiologies that could be associated with hyperglycaemia (eg, infections, dehydration, vascular events, glucocorticoids). Participants should be made aware of symptoms of hyperglycaemia (eg, polydipsia and polyuria). Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related hyperglycaemia are shown in Table 9.  In addition, for all grades, participants may receive education on lifestyle changes (eg, a diabetic diet) and consider beginning home glucose monitoring (eg, fasting self-blood glucose monitoring once daily) at the discretion of the investigator.  If glucose home monitoring is instituted, the capivasertib/placebo treatment decision should be based on the morning fasting glucose value obtained prior to the dose of capivasertib/placebo. It is recommended that approaches to the management of capivasertib-induced hyperglycaemia include advice from a diabetologist where appropriate (eg, participants with diabetes).  Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies (see below for further guidance).  If a second agent is required, consideration should be given to the intermittent schedule of capivasertib and the pattern of glucose changes (eg, sulphonylureas should be avoided due to the risk of hypoglycaemia secondary to their mechanism of action).

Investigators should exercise caution in the dosing and management of participants receiving the metformin and capivasertib/placebo combination and must be vigilant for signs of renal impairment and metformin toxicity, such as lactic acidosis and hypoglycaemia, namely: lethargy, hypotension, poor urine output, drowsiness, irritation, tachypnoea, sweating, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Due to the potential interaction of metformin and capivasertib (caused by the inhibition of renal transporters [eg, OCT2] involved in the excretion of metformin), when taking both capivasertib and metformin concurrently, participants should attend the clinic for monitoring of serum creatinine at least once per week for the first 3 weeks after initiation of metformin, then every 3 weeks thereafter. Metformin should only be given on the days when capivasertib/placebo is also administered (the half-life of capivasertib is approximately 7 to 15 hours) and should be withdrawn when treatment with capivasertib/placebo is withdrawn, unless otherwise clinically indicated. Consider withholding of metformin on the days when participants are due to have imaging with contrast (in order to reduce the already low risk of lactic acidosis) as per local guidelines. Maculo-papular Rash Dose modifications for capivasertib-related maculo-papular rash, which is the most frequent skin toxicity observed in participants treated with capivasertib, are provided in Table 10.  However, these management guidelines can be used for other skin toxicities at the discretion of the investigator and/or following consultation with the dermatologist.

BSA, body surface area; NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. Hypersensitivity In the case of hypersensitivity reactions, capivasertib/placebo should be discontinued, and symptomatic/supportive therapy should be initiated (including with antihistamines and/or steroids) as considered appropriate by the investigator/treating physician.  Drug re-challenge is not recommended; any subsequent consideration on re-challenge with capivasertib at the same or a lower dose, with its potential for recurrence of such or more severe events should be carefully considered against the potential benefits to the individual participant from continuation of capivasertib therapy and agreed with the sponsor.  Further management should follow local guidelines on management of hypersensitivity reactions. Diarrhoea Participants should be instructed to promptly contact investigators if they develop diarrhoea. Alternative aetiologies should be ruled out prior to initiating the dose modifications.  Investigators are recommended to prescribe anti-diarrhoeal treatment at the first visit so that participants can start treatment at the first sign of diarrhoea, should it occur.  Loperamide is the preferred anti-diarrhoeal agent for the management of diarrhoea occurring in participants participating in studies of capivasertib.  If diarrhoea is reported, additional details regarding this AE will be collected in the eCRF. Dose modifications for capivasertib-related diarrhoea are provided in Table 11.

For Exploratory objectives and endpoints, see Section 3 of the CSP. Overall Design This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, global study, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of capivasertib versus placebo, when added to abiraterone (+ prednisone/prednisolone) on a background of ADT in participants with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC characterised by PTEN deficiency.  PTEN status will be confirmed by investigational IHC testing of tumour tissue at central laboratories.  A participant cannot be randomised until a valid PTEN IHC result indicates PTEN deficiency.  Participants will be recruited globally from approximately 30 countries and approximately 350 study sites in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and Asia (including China and Japan). Participants will be randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive either capivasertib or matching placebo, in combination with abiraterone (+ prednisone/prednisolone) on a background of ADT.  The randomisation scheme will be stratified on the following factors: Combination of volume of disease according to CHAARTED criteria* and presence of visceral metastases** (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases/high volume disease without visceral metastases/low volume disease) * High volume (defined as the presence of visceral metastases or ≥ 4 bone lesions with ≥ 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis) versus low volume. ** For the purposes of this study, visceral metastases are defined by the list provided within the IWRS. Geographic location: North America, Western Europe, and Australia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and Asia. Disclosure Statement: This is a parallel-group treatment study with 2 arms that is participant, sponsor, and investigator blinded. Number of Participants: Approximately 5500 participants will be enrolled and screened to achieve a total of 1000 randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 treatment arms.  This is based on the planned number of 331 rPFS events that must be observed for the study to have 90% power to show a statistically significant difference in rPFS at the 2-sided 5% level, assuming a true treatment effect HR of 0.70 (see Section 9.2 for details). For regulatory submission purposes in China, the study will include approximately 150 randomised participants from sites in mainland China and those from Taiwan and Hong Kong accredited by the National Medical Product Administration (NMPA). Note: ‘Enrolled' means a participant's, or their legally acceptable representative's, agreement to participate in a clinical study following completion of the informed consent process.  Potential participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the study, but are not randomly assigned in the study, are considered ‘screen failures', unless otherwise specified by the protocol. Intervention Groups and Duration: Participants will receive oral treatment with capivasertib or matching placebo 400 mg twice daily (BD) 4 days on, 3 days off, until investigator-assessed disease progression by RECIST 1.1 or PCWG3 bone progression criteria, unacceptable toxicity, or the participant requests to stop the treatment.  Participants will also receive the approved oral dose of abiraterone (1000 mg once daily) with 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone daily.  All participants should also receive continuous ADT using either a LHRH agonist, a LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy. If either abiraterone or capivasertib/placebo is discontinued prior to disease progression, participants may remain on the other drug at the investigator's discretion until disease progression or evidence of unacceptable toxicity. Data Monitoring Committee: An independent Data Monitoring Committee will assess the progress of the study at regular intervals.  This will include reviewing unblinded safety and tolerability data and the data from the interim efficacy analysis to provide a recommendation to AstraZeneca as to whether the study should continue unchanged, be stopped, or be modified in any way. Statistical Methods: The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be used as the primary population for reporting efficacy data and to summarise baseline characteristics.  This comprises all participants randomised into the study and will be analysed according to randomised treatment regardless of the treatment received (ITT principle).  Any important deviations from randomised treatment will be listed and considered when interpreting the efficacy data.  The Safety Analysis Set will be used as the primary population for reporting safety data.  This comprises all participants randomised into the study who receive at least 1 dose of capivasertib or placebo and will be analysed according to the treatment received.  If a participant receives at least 1 dose of capivasertib they will be included in the capivasertib arm for safety summaries. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy, measured by rPFS, of capivasertib + abiraterone versus placebo + abiraterone, both groups receiving continuous ADT.  The primary endpoint is rPFS in participants who have de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC characterised by PTEN deficiency who have received no prior pharmacotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery for metastatic prostate cancer other than that which is permitted by the protocol and may have been administered for a maximum of 3 months from start of ADT to randomisation in the study.  The effect of capivasertib versus placebo will be tested using a log rank test stratified by the randomisation stratification factors.  If there are insufficient events per strata, some strata will be collapsed following rules to be pre-specified in the SAP.  From a stratified Cox proportional hazards model (ties = Efron) the HR (capivasertib + abiraterone versus placebo + abiraterone) together with its corresponding 95% CI will be presented.  A HR < 1 will favour capivasertib + abiraterone. The key secondary endpoints of OS, TFST, SSE-FS, and TTPP will be tested following a MTP to preserve the overall type 1 error (familywise error rate) in the strong sense.  Each endpoint will have its own alpha spending function and will be tested according to the group-sequential Holm variable (GSHv) procedure (Ye et al 2013).  TFST will be analysed at the rPFS interim and final analyses.  OS, SSE-FS, and TTPP will be analysed at the final rPFS analysis and again, approximately 12 months after the final rPFS analysis. The primary endpoint of rPFS (based on investigator assessment using RECIST version 1.1 [soft tissue] and PCWG3 [bone]) will be tested in an interim analysis after 222 (22% maturity) rPFS events have occurred.  With 222 events, a significant result will be declared if the observed rPFS HR is 0.593 or better at this interim analysis with a 2-sided p-value < 0.0001 (approximate relative information fraction = 67%).  The interim analysis on rPFS will be incorporated into the MTP including the key secondary endpoints, which will be analysed using the same methodology specified for the primary endpoint. When the final rPFS analysis is performed it is estimated that approximately 331 (33%) of the 1000 participants will have progressed, according to the definition of rPFS: the time from randomisation to radiographic progression assessed by investigator using RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and/or PCWG3 (bone) criteria, or death. Safety and tolerability data will be summarised using appropriate descriptive statistics. 1.2  Schema Figure 1  Study Design a  High volume is defined as the presence of visceral metastases or ≥ 4 bone lesions with ≥ 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis (Sweeney et al 2015).

Screening will be conducted in a 2-part process which must be completed within a 3-month period between the participant starting ADT and being randomised to study treatment.  This 3-month period may also include abiraterone treatment.  Screening Part 1 includes testing for PTEN status.  In Part 2, all remaining screening assessments should be performed, and must be completed within 28 days before randomisation.  Screening Part 1 and Part 2 each require a separate ICF.  Participants under screening in Part 2 must be given sufficient time to complete the 7-day BPI-SF and BFI diaries.  Table 2 provides the SoA for the study treatment and follow-up periods. Table 1  Schedule of Assessments (Screening) Screening Part 1 None  1  Schedule of Assessments (Screening) Screening Part 1 a Initial eligibility criteria review for all criteria marked with * in Section 5.1 (inclusion criteria) and Section 5.2 (exclusion criteria). b Bidimensional echocardiogram is the preferred modality because of the global technetium [Tc-99m] shortage (but MUGA can be used alternatively).  The modality of the cardiac function assessments must be consistent within subject ie, if echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment and a follow-up assessment if clinically indicated, then echocardiogram should also be used for subsequent scans.  Participants should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible. c Participants will be required to provide the most recently collected tumour sample (bone metastases or Fine Needle Aspirate [FNA] samples will not be accepted), collected as part of routine clinical practice.  Availability of a tumour sample is mandatory for all patients to enrol in the study for the determination of PTEN status by IHC.  A representative FFPE tissue block that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides must be provided, or, if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual and Pathology Testing Manual.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1; no additional slides will be collected for screening Part 1 or Part 2. d Optional tumour sample: FFPE block (preferred) or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections can be provided.  These slides will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and/ or diagnostic test development.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual and Pathology Testing Manual. e Not applicable for China participants. f Eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) are required to provide an additional tumour sample FFPE block (preferred) or 20 (minimum 15) freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  This sample will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and/or diagnostic test development.  Patients who provided optional tissue in screening Part 1 are exempt from this requirement.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. g Blood sample for determination of PSA.  Mandatory for all participants on study.  Samples to be collected both at screening and at Cycle 1, Day 1. h Tumour assessment will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a whole-body bone scan.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before randomisation, and ideally should be performed as close as possible to the start of study treatment. i BPI-SF and BFI baseline assessments to be completed by the participant in a consecutive 7-day period during screening (only after PTEN deficiency is confirmed) before randomisation (not required to be at site). j In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs/SAEs must be reported.

Cycle (4-week cycles) Cycle (4-week cycles) Cycle (4-week cycles) a Participants will receive the capivasertib recommended oral dose (400 mg twice daily on intermittent schedule [4 days on/3 days off]) or placebo until disease progression or discontinuation. b Participants will also receive the approved dose of abiraterone (1000 mg) as a single oral daily dose on each day of each cycle with 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone once daily, until disease progression or discontinuation. c Bidimensional echocardiogram is the preferred modality because of the global technetium [Tc-99m] shortage (but MUGA can be used alternatively).  The modality of the cardiac function assessments must be consistent within participant, ie, if echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment and a follow-up assessment if clinically indicated, then echocardiogram should also be used for subsequent scans.  Participants should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible. d Cycle (4-week cycles) In accordance with the abiraterone prescribing information, serum transaminase levels should continue to be measured monthly throughout treatment with abiraterone (ie, measured at every cycle until discontinuation of abiraterone treatment). e Blood sample for determination of PSA.  Mandatory for all participants on study.  Samples to be collected at screening and C1D1.  PSA progression should be confirmed with a consecutive PSA assessment at least 3 weeks later after each sample collection. f Not applicable for China participants. g Whole blood samples collected for CellSearch CTC assay at pre-treatment on C1D1, pre-treatment on C4D1, and at disease progression. h Whole blood samples collected for EPIC Sciences CTC assay pre-treatment on C1D1, and at disease progression. i Optional matched paired tumour biopsy samples will be collected from consented participants.  A baseline biopsy taken before the initial dosing of study drugs pre-dose on C1D1 (or up to 7 days before C1D1) and an on-treatment biopsy taken between C1D16 and C1D18. j Where possible and with consent, participants may be requested to provide a tumour biopsy at tumour progression. k Tumour assessment will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a whole-body bone scan.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (± 14 days) relative to the date of randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), regardless of discontinuation of study treatment (eg, discontinuation due to toxicity or clinical progression) or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy.  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged.  If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at the participant's scheduled visits.  It is important to follow the imaging assessment schedule as closely as possible; however, tumour assessment can be performed at any time when disease progression is clinically suspected.  For participants who have at least 2 new bone lesions appearing on the first post-baseline scan, confirmation of progression will be required by an additional bone scan showing 2 or more new lesions compared to the first post-baseline bone scan at least 6 weeks later (for further detail please see Appendix E). l For the BPI-SF and BFI, the C1D1 assessment is part of the 7-day diaries completed at screening (see Table 1). m The PRO-CTCAE will only be administered where a linguistically validated version exists for a country. n In addition to regular contacts at 12-week intervals, participants will be contacted in the 7 days following a specified date (data cut-off date) for survival analysis. o Participants will enter the PFS2 follow-up period once the participant has discontinued study treatment due to progressive disease by RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue lesions and/or PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions.  In the survival follow-up period following PFS, all subsequent cancer therapies and vital status will be documented at least every 12 weeks until death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first.

          "InclusionCriteria": "5.3.1  Inclusion Criteria For inclusion in the trial, all of the following inclusion criteria must be fulfilled: Histologically or cytologically confirmed HCC Subjects with advanced HCC of BCLC Stage C A tumor biopsy (excluding fine needle aspiration and cytology samples) is required for determining MET status (a fresh pretreatment tumor biopsy is recommended but archived tumor sample is acceptable).  From the pretreatment biopsy, either a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded block with tumor tissue (preferred) or 10 to 15 unstained slides must be sent to the central laboratory prior to enrollment.  An associated pathology report must also be sent with the sample. MET+ status (phase II only), as determined by the central laboratory (phase Ib retrospectively, phase II for subject selection) is defined as c-Met protein overexpression (e.g., moderate (2+) or strong (3+) staining intensity for c-Met using IHC in the majority [≥ 50%] of tumor cells) (see Appendix A) NOTE: The main purpose of the phase Ib trial is to determine the RP2D, safety, and PK profile of MSC2156119J in HCC subjects, therefore, MET+ status is not an eligibility criterion for phase Ib.

          "AdverseEvents": "7.4.1  Adverse Events 7.4.1.1  Adverse Event Definitions Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself. In case of a fatality, the cause of death is considered as the AE, and the death is considered as its outcome. The investigator is required to grade the severity/intensity of each AE by referencing the NCI-CTCAE, version 4.0 (publication date: 28 May 2009).  This is a descriptive terminology that can be used for AE reporting.  A general grading (severity/intensity) scale is provided at the beginning of the referenced document, and specific event grades are also provided. If a particular AE's severity/intensity is not specifically graded by the guidance document, the investigator is to revert to the general definitions of Grade 1 through Grade 5 as shown below and use his or her best medical judgment. The 5 general grades are: Grade 1:  Grade 1: Mild  Mild Grade 2:  Grade 2: Moderate  Moderate Grade 3:  Grade 3: Severe  Severe Grade 4:  Grade 4: Life-threatening or disabling  Life-threatening or disabling Grade 5:  Grade 5: Death related to AE*  Death related to AE* Grade 1: Mild Grade 2: Moderate Grade 3: Severe Grade 4: Life-threatening or disabling Grade 5: Death related to AE* According to the Sponsor's convention, if a severity/intensity of Grade 4 or 5 is applied to an AE, then the Investigator must also report the event as a serious adverse event (SAE; see definition below) as per Section 7.4.1.4.  However, a laboratory abnormality with a severity/intensity of Grade 4, such as anemia or neutropenia, is considered serious only if the condition meets one of the serious criteria described below. *Note: Death (Grade 5 as defined by NCI-CTCAE version 4.0) is mainly regarded as an outcome, to be documented as described below. In the case of death, the primary cause of death (the event leading to death) should be recorded and reported as a SAE.  “Fatal” will be recorded as the outcome of this respective event; death will not be recorded as separate event.  Only if no cause of death can be reported (e.g., sudden death, unexplained death), the death per se might be reported as a SAE. Investigators must also systematically assess the causal relationship of AEs to MSC2156119J using the following definitions.  Decisive factors for the assessment of causal relationship of an AE to MSC2156119J include, but may not be limited to, temporal relationship between the AE and MSC2156119J, known side effects of MSC2156119J, medical history, concomitant medication, course of the underlying disease, or trial procedures. Not related: Not suspected to be reasonably related to MSC2156119J.  The AE could not medically (pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to MSC2156119J under study in this clinical trial protocol.  A reasonable alternative explanation must be available. Related: Suspected to be reasonably related to MSC2156119J.  The AE could medically (pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to MSC2156119J under study in this clinical trial protocol. Abnormal Laboratory Findings and Other Abnormal Investigational Findings Abnormal laboratory findings and other abnormal investigational findings (e.g.  on an ECG trace) should not be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and symptoms, lead to treatment discontinuation or are considered otherwise medically important by the Investigator.  If an abnormality fulfills these criteria, the identified medical condition (e.g.  anemia, increased ALT) must be reported as the AE rather than the abnormal value itself. Serious Adverse Event A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: Results in death Is life-threatening NOTE: The term “life-threatening” in this definition refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Is otherwise considered as medically important Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered as SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. For the purposes of reporting, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via MSC2156119J is also considered a serious adverse reaction and all such cases should be reported in an expedited manner as described in Section 7.4.1.4. Events that Do Not Meet the Definition of a SAE Elective hospitalizations to administer, or to simplify trial treatment or trial procedures (e.g., an overnight stay to facilitate chemotherapy and related hydration therapy application) are not considered as SAEs.  However, all events leading to unplanned hospitalizations or unplanned prolongation of an elective hospitalization (e.g., undesirable effects of any administered treatment) must be documented and reported as SAEs. Events Not to Be Considered as AEs/SAEs Medical conditions present at the initial trial visit that do not worsen in severity or frequency during the trial are defined as baseline medical conditions, and are NOT to be considered AEs. AE/SAEs Observed in Association with Disease Progression Disease progression recorded in the course of efficacy assessments only, but without any adverse signs or symptoms should not be reported as an AE. However, if adverse signs or symptoms occur in association with disease progression then these should be recorded as AEs and reported as SAEs if meeting any seriousness criteria. Predefined AEs of Special Interest for Safety Monitoring Subjects might experience asymptomatic elevations in serum pancreatic enzyme (lipase and amylase).  Such an enzyme elevation of Grade ≥ 3 is considered an AESI in this trial. When such AESI is not serious, a specific AESI form should be filled at the site and the sponsor must be notified immediately (within 24 hours).  Reporting process of an AESI should follow the same procedure for reporting SAEs (see Section 7.4.1.4). Should the AESI be serious, a SAE Report Form (Clinical Trial) instead of the AESI form should be filled and the procedure for reporting SAEs (see Section 7.4.1.4) should be also carried on. In addition to SAEs, all DLTs will be expeditiously sent by the investigator to the sponsor using the AE section of the eCRF. 7.4.1.2  Methods of Recording and Assessing Adverse Events At each trial visit, the subject will be queried on changes in his/her condition.  During the reporting period of the trial any unfavorable changes in the subject's condition will be recorded as AEs, whether reported by the subject or observed by the investigator. Complete, accurate and consistent data on all AEs experienced for the duration of the reporting period (defined below) will be reported on an ongoing basis in the appropriate section of the eCRF.  Among these AEs, all SAEs must be additionally documented and reported using an SAE Report Form (Clinical Trial) as described in Section 7.4.1.4. It is important that each AE report include a description of the event, its duration (onset and resolution dates [/times “/times” to be completed when it is important to assess the time of AE onset relative to the recorded treatment administration time]), its severity, its relationship with the trial treatment, any other potential causal factors, any treatment given or other action taken (including dose modification or discontinuation of MSC2156119J) and its outcome.  In addition, serious cases should be identified and the appropriate seriousness criteria documented. Specific guidance can be found in the eCRF Completion and Monitoring Conventions provided by the sponsor. 7.4.1.3  Definition of the Adverse Event Reporting Period The AE reporting period for safety surveillance begins when the subject is included into the trial (date of first signature of informed consent) and continues through the trial's post-treatment follow-up visit, as defined in Section 7.1.5.  If post-treatment follow-up visit was not performed (e.g., the subject could not come back to the site for a visit), a telephone contact should be completed and documented for AE assessment. Any SAE suspected to be related to trial treatment must be reported whenever it occurs, irrespective of the time elapsed since the last administration of trial treatment. 7.4.1.4  Procedure for Reporting Serious Adverse Events In the event of any new SAE occurring during the reporting period, the investigator must immediately (i.e., within a maximum 24 hours after becoming aware of the event) inform the person(s) identified in the SAE Report Form (Clinical Trials) by telephone, by fax, or by e-mail. When an event (or follow-up information) is reported by telephone, a written report must be sent immediately thereafter by fax or e-mail. Reporting procedures and timelines are the same for any new information on a previously reported SAE (= follow-up). For names, addresses, telephone and fax numbers for SAE reporting, see the relevant section in the SAE Report Form (Clinical Trials). All written reports should be transmitted using the SAE Report Form (Clinical Trials), which must be completed by the investigator following specific completion instructions. The AE section of the eCRF must be completed and a copy of the information transmitted with the SAE Report Form (Clinical Trials).  Other relevant pages from the eCRF may also be provided (e.g., medical history, concomitant drugs). The investigator/reporter must respond to any request for follow-up information (e.g., additional information, outcome and final evaluation, specific records where needed) or to any question the sponsor may have on the AE within the same timelines as described for initial reports.  This is necessary to permit a prompt assessment of the event by the sponsor and (as applicable) to allow the Company to meet strict regulatory timelines associated with expedited safety reporting obligations. Requests for follow-up will usually be made by the Drug Safety responsible via the responsible monitor, although in exceptional circumstances the medical responsible may contact the investigator directly to obtain clarification or to discuss a particularly critical event. 7.4.1.5 Safety Reporting to Health Authorities, Independent Ethics Committees/ Institutional Review Boards and Investigators The sponsor will send appropriate safety notifications to Health Authorities in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The investigator must comply with any applicable site-specific requirements related to the reporting of SAEs (and in particular deaths) involving his/her subjects to the IEC/IRB that approved the trial. In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the sponsor will inform the investigator of “findings that could adversely affect the safety of subjects, impact the conduct of the trial, or alter the IEC's/IRB's approval/favorable opinion to continue the trial.” In particular and in line with respective regulations, the sponsor will inform the investigator of AEs that are both serious and unexpected and are considered to be related to the administered product suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs).  The investigator should place copies of safety reports in the Investigator Site File.  National regulations with regard to safety report notifications to investigators will be taken into account. When specifically required by regulations and guidelines, the sponsor will provide appropriate Safety reports directly to the concerned lead IEC/IRB and will maintain records of these notifications.  When direct reporting by the sponsor is not clearly defined by national or site-specific regulations, the investigator will be responsible for promptly notifying the concerned IEC/IRB of any Safety reports provided by the sponsor and of filing copies of all related correspondence in the Investigator Site File. For trials covered by the European Directive 2001/20/EC, the sponsor's responsibilities regarding the reporting of SAEs/SUSARs/Safety Issues will be carried out in accordance with that Directive and with the related Detailed Guidances. 7.4.1.6  Monitoring of Subjects with Adverse Events AEs are recorded and assessed continuously throughout the study (see Section 7.4.1.3) and are assessed for final outcome at the post-treatment follow-up visit.  All SAEs ongoing at the post-treatment follow-up visit must be monitored and followed up by the investigator until stabilization or until the outcome is known, unless the subject is documented as “lost to follow-up.” Reasonable attempts to obtain this information must be made and documented.  It is also the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that any necessary additional therapeutic measures and follow-up procedures are performed.",
          "SeriousAdverseEvents": "7.4.1.4  Procedure for Reporting Serious Adverse Events In the event of any new SAE occurring during the reporting period, the investigator must immediately (i.e., within a maximum 24 hours after becoming aware of the event) inform the person(s) identified in the SAE Report Form (Clinical Trials) by telephone, by fax, or by e-mail. When an event (or follow-up information) is reported by telephone, a written report must be sent immediately thereafter by fax or e-mail.

          "Endpoints": "8.5.2  Analysis of Primary Endpoints 8.5.2.1  Statistical Analysis of the Dose Escalation Cohort The DLT Analysis Set will be used for evaluation of the number of subjects experiencing any DLTs at the end of each cohort and for the assessment of the MTD/RP2D. For final statistical analysis, the number and proportion of subjects in the DLT population who experienced DLT during the Cycle 1 of treatment with MSC2156119J will be presented by dose level.  Subject disposition will be reported for each dose level, and subject profiles will be presented. Listings and graphics of information which is relevant to the primary endpoint will be prepared for the SMC, for the purpose of determination of the MTD/RP2D of MSC2156119J in Asian subjects, according to the content agreed and specified in the SMC's charter. The MTD/RP2D will be determined as described in Section 6.2.3. 8.5.2.2  Statistical Analysis of Primary Endpoint of Phase II The primary endpoint of phase II in this trial is TTP assessed by an IRC.  TTP is defined as the time (in months) from randomization to date of the observation of radiological PD assessed by an IRC.  Death without radiological progression date will be censored.  In subjects without a progression date or loss to follow-up at time of analysis, the time between the date of randomization and the date of last tumor assessment will be calculated and used as a censored observation in the analysis.  In principle, all tumor assessment should be considered to determine and derive the date of radiological progression. The primary analysis will test the equality of TTP between treatment groups, based on the ITT Population, applying two-sided stratified log-rank test at a significance level of 10% and taking account strata used for randomization, i.e., ECOG PS (0 and 1 vs.  2).. The following null-hypothesis is tested: H0: A(t) = B(t) versus H1: A(t) = B(t),  1, where (t) represents the hazard at time t and  the unknown constant of proportionality of hazards in the allocated treatment groups (MSC2156119J and sorafenib). The HR (including 90% CI) of MSC2156119J compared to sorafenib will be calculated by Cox's proportional hazards model stratified according to strata used for randomization, i.e., ECOG PS (0 and 1 vs.  2). Kaplan-Meier survival curves (product-limit estimates) will be presented by treatment arm together with a summary of associated statistics (median survival time, 6-month, 12-month survival rate estimates and estimates for every 6 months thereafter as applicable) including the corresponding two-sided 90% CIs.  The CIs for the median will be calculated according to Brookmeyer and Crowley, and CIs for the survival function estimates at above defined time points will be derived directly from the Kaplan-Meier estimates.  The estimate of the standard error will be computed using Greenwood's formula.   Comparisons of survival rates will be performed from a Z-test using estimates and standard errors derived from the Kaplan-Meier method and Greenwood's formula.   Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 8.5.2.3  Progression-free Survival Progression-free survival (assessed by investigator) time is defined as the time (in months) from randomization to either first observation of progression disease or occurrence of death due to any cause within 42 days of either randomization or the last tumor assessment.  If no progression or death is observed, or if death without previously documented PD is observed after more than 42 days of last tumor assessment without progression, the PFS time will be censored on the date of last tumor assessment or date of randomization, whatever occurs later.  The 42-day time window represents the time between scheduled tumor assessments. Treatment groups will be compared based on ITT population, applying two-sided log-rank test at a significance level of 10% taking into account randomization strata, ECOG PS (0 and 1 vs.  2). The same survival analysis methods will be employed as for the primary endpoint, PFS will be further explored considering the PP Population and pre-defined subgroups (see Section 8.4). 8.5.2.4  Overall Survival A preliminary analysis on overall survival will be performed at the time when TTP is statistically analyzed.  Final OS analysis will be carried out when at least two thirds of events have been reported. Overall survival will be measured as the time (in months) between the date of randomization and the date of death.  The analysis will be performed on the basis of the ITT principle on the primary analysis population.  OS time (in months) is defined as: (date of death or last date known to be alive - date of randomization + 1) / 30.4375. For subjects not known to be deceased at time of analysis, the time between date of randomization and date of last contact or date of lost to follow-up will be calculated and used as a censored observation in the analysis.  If this date is after the data cut-off, subjects will be censored at the date of data cut-off. Treatment groups will be compared based on the ITT Population, applying two-sided stratified log-rank test (α = 10%) taking into account strata used for randomization, i.e., ECOG PS (0 and 1 vs.  2). OS data will be further explored considering the PP Population and predefined subgroups (see Section 8.4). 8.5.2.5  Time-to-symptomatic Progression Time-to-symptomatic progression is defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of deterioration of symptoms assessed by FHSI-8, defined as the total score increase by at least 4 points compared with the baseline value, or deterioration to ECOG PS 4.  The analysis will be performed on the basis of the ITT principle on the primary analysis population at time when TTP is statistically analyzed. Treatment groups will be compared based on the ITT Population, applying two-sided stratified log-rank test (α = 10%) taking into account strata used for randomization, i.e., ECOG PS (0 and 1 vs.  2). TTSP data will be further explored considering the PP Population and predefined subgroups (see Section 8.4). 8.5.2.6  Antitumor Activity Objective response and disease control will be evaluated based on the ITT Population. The objective response rate is defined as the proportion of subjects having achieved CR or PR as the best overall response according to local radiological assessments from randomization until the first occurrence of PD.  Responses do not require confirmation according to RECIST v 1.1 (see Appendix C). The disease control rate is defined as the proportion of subjects having achieved CR, PR, or SD as the best overall response according to local radiological assessments from randomization until the first occurrence of PD.  In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 42 days after randomization. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test will be performed for analysis using the randomization strata, i.e., ECOG PS (0 and 1 vs.  2). The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel will test the following two-sided hypothesis: H0: Ψ = 1 versus H1: Ψ ≠ 1 where Ψ defines the common odds ratio across all strata. The OR rate and disease control rate will be presented for each treatment group including the corresponding 90% Newcombe-Wilson CIs. Duration of response will be presented descriptively. Further exploratory analyses will be performed using the PP population.  Tumor response will be explored in predefined subgroups (see Section 8.4). 8.5.2.7  Safety and Tolerability The Safety Analysis Set will be used for summaries of demographic and baseline characteristics, as well as for all summaries of safety data (except for DLT analysis). Safety analyses will be performed according to as-treated principle.  Any treatment emergent AEs will be summarized, i.e., those events that emergent during treatment having been absent pretreatment, or worsen relative to the pretreatment state and with onset dates occurring within the first dosing day of study treatment until 33 days after the last dose of study treatment.  No formal statistical comparisons are planned. The extent of exposure to MSC2156119J and sorafenib will be characterized by time on treatment (weeks), cumulative dose, dose intensity, relative dose intensity (actual cumulative dose/planned dose), number of dose reductions, and number of dose delays. AEs will be coded according to the MedDRA.  Severity of AEs will be graded using NCI-CTCAE (version 4.0) toxicity grade.  The incidence and type of AEs, SAEs, study treatment-related AEs and SAEs, AEs of Grade ≥ 3 by NCI-CTCAE, study treatment-related AEs of Grade ≥ 3 by NCI-CTCAE, AEs leading to death, study treatment-related AEs leading to death, and AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation will be summarized in total and for each treatment group according to MedDRA system organ class and MedDRA preferred terms.  Adverse event summaries will be prepared for Cycle 1 and the whole treatment period. All deaths and deaths within 33 days after last dose of study treatment as well as reasons for death will be tabulated. Laboratory results will be classified according to NCI-CTCAE (version 4.0).  The worst on-treatment grades after the first dose of the study treatment will be summarized.  Shifts in toxicity grades from treatment start to the highest grade will be displayed.  Results for variables that were not part of the NCI-CTCAE will be presented as below, within and above the normal limits of the local laboratory.  Only subjects with post-baseline laboratory values will be included in these analyses.  The last measurement before study treatment will serve as the baseline measurement.  Descriptive summaries of actual (absolute) laboratory values and changes from baseline will be presented. Changes in body weight from baseline to measurements during the treatment phase will be classified according to the NCI-CTCAE (version 4.0) criteria.  The highest change from baseline will summarized. Clinically significant, abnormal findings from 12-lead ECG during treatment phase will be descriptively presented. Changes from baseline to worst on-treatment value will be summarized descriptively for the QTc interval (including absolute changes and categorical shifts). Vital signs (body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate) recorded at baseline will be descriptively presented. The baseline results of the physical examination will be presented.  Clinically significant, abnormal findings from the physical examination are to be reported as AEs.  Separate summaries of the physical examination during and after treatment will not be provided.

          "InclusionCriteria": "5.1  Inclusion Criteria Participants are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria apply: Age 1  *Participant must be ≥ 18 years of age (≥ 20 years of age in Japan), at the time of signing the informed consent. Type of Participant and Disease Characteristics *Histologically-confirmed de novo (ie, diagnosed within 3 months of randomisation) metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma.  Note: adenocarcinoma must be the primary histological pattern and patients with small-cell tumours are not eligible. *Consent to provide a FFPE tissue block (preferred) or slides.  Details on tissue requirements are specified in the Laboratory Manual.  Cytologic or FNA samples are not acceptable.  Tumour tissue from bone metastases is not acceptable. *A valid PTEN IHC result indicating PTEN deficiency (centralised testing). Metastatic disease documented prior to randomisation by clear evidence of ≥ 1 bone lesion (defined as 1 lesion with positive uptake on bone scan) and/or ≥ 1 soft tissue lesion (measurable and/or non-measurable) that can be accurately assessed at baseline and is suitable for repeated assessment with CT and/or MRI.  Patients with metastatic disease identified by PSMA PET only, will not be eligible.  Local lymph node involvement is not considered metastatic disease. Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic form of prostate cancer based on the investigator's clinical evaluation. *Candidate for abiraterone and steroid therapy.  Previous treatment with abiraterone and/or a steroid for de novo disease is allowed up to a maximum of 3 months prior to randomisation (prior treatment with chemotherapy or other NHAs is not allowed). Ongoing ADT with GnRH analogue (combination with first generation androgen receptor antagonists, eg, bicalutamide is allowed), or LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy.  Duration of ongoing ADT (regardless of method) is from 0 days to a maximum of 3 months prior to randomisation. ECOG/WHO performance status 0 to 1 (see Appendix A) with no deterioration over the previous 2 weeks and minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks. *Able and willing to swallow and retain oral medication. Participants must complete the 7-day BPI-SF and BFI questionnaires and the analgesic diary during screening (only after PTEN deficiency is confirmed), prior to randomisation.  Note: it is required to give participants at least 7 consecutive days to complete the assessments prior to randomisation.  If a minimum of 4 assessments is not completed during the 7-day period, participants must be re-screened, a new 7 days of questionnaire/diary entries completed, and any screening tests which are consequently outside of the applicable 28 days prior to randomisation must also be repeated.  Sex *Participants will be male. Reproduction 13  Agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm: Sterilisation (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). Participants should use barrier contraception (ie, condoms) from the time of screening until 16 weeks after discontinuation of study drug.  It is not known whether the pre-clinical changes seen in the male animal reproductive organs, after treatment with capivasertib, will be fully reversible or will permanently affect the ability to produce healthy sperm following treatment.  Therefore, if participants wish to father children, they should be advised to arrange for collection of sperm samples prior to the start of study treatment. Informed Consent *Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix B 3, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICF and in this CSP. Provision of signed and dated written Optional Genetic Research Information informed consent prior to collection of samples for optional genetic research that supports Genomic Initiative.",

          "AdverseEvents": "8.3  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The Principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix H. AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorised representative). The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE.  For information on how to follow up AEs see Section 8.3.2. 8.3.1  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information Adverse events, including SAEs, will be collected from time of signature of the ICF, throughout the treatment period and including the 30-day follow-up period after discontinuation of study drug.  * *In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs/SAEs must be reported. If the investigator becomes aware of a SAE with a suspected causal relationship to the IMP that occurs after the end of the clinical study in a participant treated by him or her, the investigator shall, without undue delay, report the SAE to the sponsor. 8.3.2  Follow-up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  All SAEs/non-serious AEs (as defined in Appendix H), will be followed until resolution, stabilisation, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up. A post-study assessment will be performed preferably within 7 days of the time that the IMP is permanently discontinued. Safety follow-up should be carried out with the participant 30 days (+ 7 days) after the discontinuation of study treatment to follow-up any SAEs/AEs and concomitant medications (including any subsequent cancer therapy). Any AE/SAE/abnormal laboratory findings that are ongoing at the time of study treatment discontinuation or any new treatment related events within 30 days of study treatment, must be followed up to resolution or until the event becomes stable (or returns to baseline) or is unlikely to resolve further in the opinion of the investigator. Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant's last AE assessment or other assessment/visit as appropriate in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF.  AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any participant with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 8.3.3  Adverse Event Variables The following variables will be collected for each AE: AE (verbatim) The date when the AE started and stopped CTCAE grade and changes in CTCAE grade Whether the AE is serious or not Investigator causality rating against the IMP(s) (yes or no) Action taken with regard to IMP(s) AE caused participant's withdrawal from study (yes or no) Outcome. In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: Date AE met criteria for serious AE Date investigator became aware of SAE AE is serious due to Date of hospitalisation Date of discharge Probable cause of death Date of death Autopsy performed Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) Causality assessment to other medication 8.3.4  Causality Collection The investigator should assess the causal relationship between the IMP and each AE, and answer ‘yes' or ‘no' to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?' For SAEs, causal relationship should also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes'. A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix H. 8.3.5  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the participant or reported in response to the open question from the study site staff (eg, ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?'), or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF.  When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 8.3.6  Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests The results from the CSP-mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG abnormalities should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria, are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product or are considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the investigator (which may include but not limited to consideration as to whether treatment or non-planned visits were required or other action was taken with the study treatment, eg, dose adjustment or drug interruption). If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally related to the disease under study (see Section 8.3.8). 8.3.7  Hy's Law Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3xULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN may need to be reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix G for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy's Law. 8.3.8  Disease Progression Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a participant's condition attributable to the disease for which the investigational product is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The development of new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events that are unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an AE during the study. 8.3.9  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational product, or to the study procedure(s)*.  All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. *In Screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting). If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately.  investigators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the EDC system, an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the EDC system is not available, then the investigator or other study site staff reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the investigator/study site staff how to proceed. For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix H. The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness for capivasertib is the current IB; for abiraterone, the local prescribing information is the reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness. 8.3.10  Pregnancy Paternal Exposure Participants should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 16 weeks following the last dose of capivasertib/placebo. Pregnancy of the participants' partners is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until 16 weeks after the last dose should, if possible, be followed up and documented. 8.3.11  Medication Error If a medication error occurs in the course of the study, then the investigator or other site personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is completed within 1 (Initial Fatal/Life-Threatening or follow up Fatal/Life-Threatening) or 5 (other serious initial and follow up) calendar days if there is an SAE associated with the medication error (see Section 8.3.9) and within 30 days for all other medication errors. The definition of a Medication Error can be found in Appendix H 4. 8.3.12  Management of Capivasertib-related Toxicities 8.3.12.1  Capivasertib/Placebo Dose Modification and Guidance Please refer to Section 6.6 for guidance on dose modifications. 8.3.12.2  Dose Modifications due to General Capivasertib-related Toxicities Treatment with capivasertib/placebo should be temporarily interrupted for any intolerable AE regardless of grade or for any AEs grade ≥ 3 that occurs despite optimal supportive care, are not attributable to the disease under investigation, where the investigator considers the AE of concern to be specifically associated with capivasertib.  Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related toxicities are shown in Table 8.  Appropriate and optimal treatment of the toxicity is assumed prior to considering dose modifications.  The Study Physician may be consulted prior to discontinuation of study drug due to toxicities.

In participants who are diabetic, it may be beneficial to rule out concomitant aetiologies that could be associated with hyperglycaemia (eg, infections, dehydration, vascular events, glucocorticoids). Participants should be made aware of symptoms of hyperglycaemia (eg, polydipsia and polyuria). Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related hyperglycaemia are shown in Table 9.  In addition, for all grades, participants may receive education on lifestyle changes (eg, a diabetic diet) and consider beginning home glucose monitoring (eg, fasting self-blood glucose monitoring once daily) at the discretion of the investigator.  If glucose home monitoring is instituted, the capivasertib/placebo treatment decision should be based on the morning fasting glucose value obtained prior to the dose of capivasertib/placebo. It is recommended that approaches to the management of capivasertib-induced hyperglycaemia include advice from a diabetologist where appropriate (eg, participants with diabetes).  Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies (see below for further guidance).  If a second agent is required, consideration should be given to the intermittent schedule of capivasertib and the pattern of glucose changes (eg, sulphonylureas should be avoided due to the risk of hypoglycaemia secondary to their mechanism of action).

NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0; SBGM, self-blood glucose monitoring. Use of metformin Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies.  Investigators should exercise caution in the dosing and management of participants receiving the metformin and capivasertib/placebo combination and must be vigilant for signs of renal impairment and metformin toxicity, such as lactic acidosis and hypoglycaemia, namely: lethargy, hypotension, poor urine output, drowsiness, irritation, tachypnoea, sweating, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Due to the potential interaction of metformin and capivasertib (caused by the inhibition of renal transporters [eg, OCT2] involved in the excretion of metformin), when taking both capivasertib and metformin concurrently, participants should attend the clinic for monitoring of serum creatinine at least once per week for the first 3 weeks after initiation of metformin, then every 3 weeks thereafter. Metformin should only be given on the days when capivasertib/placebo is also administered (the half-life of capivasertib is approximately 7 to 15 hours) and should be withdrawn when treatment with capivasertib/placebo is withdrawn, unless otherwise clinically indicated. Consider withholding of metformin on the days when participants are due to have imaging with contrast (in order to reduce the already low risk of lactic acidosis) as per local guidelines. Maculo-papular Rash Dose modifications for capivasertib-related maculo-papular rash, which is the most frequent skin toxicity observed in participants treated with capivasertib, are provided in Table 10.  However, these management guidelines can be used for other skin toxicities at the discretion of the investigator and/or following consultation with the dermatologist.

BSA, body surface area; NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. Hypersensitivity In the case of hypersensitivity reactions, capivasertib/placebo should be discontinued, and symptomatic/supportive therapy should be initiated (including with antihistamines and/or steroids) as considered appropriate by the investigator/treating physician.  Drug re-challenge is not recommended; any subsequent consideration on re-challenge with capivasertib at the same or a lower dose, with its potential for recurrence of such or more severe events should be carefully considered against the potential benefits to the individual participant from continuation of capivasertib therapy and agreed with the sponsor.  Further management should follow local guidelines on management of hypersensitivity reactions. Diarrhoea Participants should be instructed to promptly contact investigators if they develop diarrhoea. Alternative aetiologies should be ruled out prior to initiating the dose modifications.  Investigators are recommended to prescribe anti-diarrhoeal treatment at the first visit so that participants can start treatment at the first sign of diarrhoea, should it occur.  Loperamide is the preferred anti-diarrhoeal agent for the management of diarrhoea occurring in participants participating in studies of capivasertib.  If diarrhoea is reported, additional details regarding this AE will be collected in the eCRF. Dose modifications for capivasertib-related diarrhoea are provided in Table 11.

          "SeriousAdverseEvents": "8.3  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The Principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix H. AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorised representative). The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE.  For information on how to follow up AEs see Section 8.3.2. 8.3.1  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information Adverse events, including SAEs, will be collected from time of signature of the ICF, throughout the treatment period and including the 30-day follow-up period after discontinuation of study drug.  * *In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs/SAEs must be reported. If the investigator becomes aware of a SAE with a suspected causal relationship to the IMP that occurs after the end of the clinical study in a participant treated by him or her, the investigator shall, without undue delay, report the SAE to the sponsor. 8.3.2  Follow-up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  All SAEs/non-serious AEs (as defined in Appendix H), will be followed until resolution, stabilisation, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up. A post-study assessment will be performed preferably within 7 days of the time that the IMP is permanently discontinued. Safety follow-up should be carried out with the participant 30 days (+ 7 days) after the discontinuation of study treatment to follow-up any SAEs/AEs and concomitant medications (including any subsequent cancer therapy). Any AE/SAE/abnormal laboratory findings that are ongoing at the time of study treatment discontinuation or any new treatment related events within 30 days of study treatment, must be followed up to resolution or until the event becomes stable (or returns to baseline) or is unlikely to resolve further in the opinion of the investigator. Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant's last AE assessment or other assessment/visit as appropriate in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF.  AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any participant with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 8.3.3  Adverse Event Variables The following variables will be collected for each AE: AE (verbatim) The date when the AE started and stopped CTCAE grade and changes in CTCAE grade Whether the AE is serious or not Investigator causality rating against the IMP(s) (yes or no) Action taken with regard to IMP(s) AE caused participant's withdrawal from study (yes or no) Outcome. In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: Date AE met criteria for serious AE Date investigator became aware of SAE AE is serious due to Date of hospitalisation Date of discharge Probable cause of death Date of death Autopsy performed Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) Causality assessment to other medication 8.3.4  Causality Collection The investigator should assess the causal relationship between the IMP and each AE, and answer ‘yes' or ‘no' to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?' For SAEs, causal relationship should also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes'. A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix H. 8.3.5  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the participant or reported in response to the open question from the study site staff (eg, ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?'), or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF.  When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 8.3.6  Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests The results from the CSP-mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG abnormalities should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria, are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product or are considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the investigator (which may include but not limited to consideration as to whether treatment or non-planned visits were required or other action was taken with the study treatment, eg, dose adjustment or drug interruption). If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally related to the disease under study (see Section 8.3.8). 8.3.7  Hy's Law Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3xULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN may need to be reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix G for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy's Law. 8.3.8  Disease Progression Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a participant's condition attributable to the disease for which the investigational product is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The development of new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events that are unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an AE during the study. 8.3.9  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational product, or to the study procedure(s)*.  All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. *In Screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting). If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately.  investigators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the EDC system, an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the EDC system is not available, then the investigator or other study site staff reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the investigator/study site staff how to proceed. For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix H. The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness for capivasertib is the current IB; for abiraterone, the local prescribing information is the reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness. 8.3.10  Pregnancy Paternal Exposure Participants should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 16 weeks following the last dose of capivasertib/placebo. Pregnancy of the participants' partners is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until 16 weeks after the last dose should, if possible, be followed up and documented. 8.3.11  Medication Error If a medication error occurs in the course of the study, then the investigator or other site personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is completed within 1 (Initial Fatal/Life-Threatening or follow up Fatal/Life-Threatening) or 5 (other serious initial and follow up) calendar days if there is an SAE associated with the medication error (see Section 8.3.9) and within 30 days for all other medication errors. The definition of a Medication Error can be found in Appendix H 4. 8.3.12  Management of Capivasertib-related Toxicities 8.3.12.1  Capivasertib/Placebo Dose Modification and Guidance Please refer to Section 6.6 for guidance on dose modifications. 8.3.12.2  Dose Modifications due to General Capivasertib-related Toxicities Treatment with capivasertib/placebo should be temporarily interrupted for any intolerable AE regardless of grade or for any AEs grade ≥ 3 that occurs despite optimal supportive care, are not attributable to the disease under investigation, where the investigator considers the AE of concern to be specifically associated with capivasertib.  Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related toxicities are shown in Table 8.  Appropriate and optimal treatment of the toxicity is assumed prior to considering dose modifications.  The Study Physician may be consulted prior to discontinuation of study drug due to toxicities.

In participants who are diabetic, it may be beneficial to rule out concomitant aetiologies that could be associated with hyperglycaemia (eg, infections, dehydration, vascular events, glucocorticoids). Participants should be made aware of symptoms of hyperglycaemia (eg, polydipsia and polyuria). Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related hyperglycaemia are shown in Table 9.  In addition, for all grades, participants may receive education on lifestyle changes (eg, a diabetic diet) and consider beginning home glucose monitoring (eg, fasting self-blood glucose monitoring once daily) at the discretion of the investigator.  If glucose home monitoring is instituted, the capivasertib/placebo treatment decision should be based on the morning fasting glucose value obtained prior to the dose of capivasertib/placebo. It is recommended that approaches to the management of capivasertib-induced hyperglycaemia include advice from a diabetologist where appropriate (eg, participants with diabetes).  Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies (see below for further guidance).  If a second agent is required, consideration should be given to the intermittent schedule of capivasertib and the pattern of glucose changes (eg, sulphonylureas should be avoided due to the risk of hypoglycaemia secondary to their mechanism of action).

Use of metformin Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies.  Investigators should exercise caution in the dosing and management of participants receiving the metformin and capivasertib/placebo combination and must be vigilant for signs of renal impairment and metformin toxicity, such as lactic acidosis and hypoglycaemia, namely: lethargy, hypotension, poor urine output, drowsiness, irritation, tachypnoea, sweating, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Due to the potential interaction of metformin and capivasertib (caused by the inhibition of renal transporters [eg, OCT2] involved in the excretion of metformin), when taking both capivasertib and metformin concurrently, participants should attend the clinic for monitoring of serum creatinine at least once per week for the first 3 weeks after initiation of metformin, then every 3 weeks thereafter. Metformin should only be given on the days when capivasertib/placebo is also administered (the half-life of capivasertib is approximately 7 to 15 hours) and should be withdrawn when treatment with capivasertib/placebo is withdrawn, unless otherwise clinically indicated. Consider withholding of metformin on the days when participants are due to have imaging with contrast (in order to reduce the already low risk of lactic acidosis) as per local guidelines. Maculo-papular Rash Dose modifications for capivasertib-related maculo-papular rash, which is the most frequent skin toxicity observed in participants treated with capivasertib, are provided in Table 10.  However, these management guidelines can be used for other skin toxicities at the discretion of the investigator and/or following consultation with the dermatologist.

BSA, body surface area; NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. Hypersensitivity In the case of hypersensitivity reactions, capivasertib/placebo should be discontinued, and symptomatic/supportive therapy should be initiated (including with antihistamines and/or steroids) as considered appropriate by the investigator/treating physician.  Drug re-challenge is not recommended; any subsequent consideration on re-challenge with capivasertib at the same or a lower dose, with its potential for recurrence of such or more severe events should be carefully considered against the potential benefits to the individual participant from continuation of capivasertib therapy and agreed with the sponsor.  Further management should follow local guidelines on management of hypersensitivity reactions. Diarrhoea Participants should be instructed to promptly contact investigators if they develop diarrhoea. Alternative aetiologies should be ruled out prior to initiating the dose modifications.  Investigators are recommended to prescribe anti-diarrhoeal treatment at the first visit so that participants can start treatment at the first sign of diarrhoea, should it occur.  Loperamide is the preferred anti-diarrhoeal agent for the management of diarrhoea occurring in participants participating in studies of capivasertib.  If diarrhoea is reported, additional details regarding this AE will be collected in the eCRF. Dose modifications for capivasertib-related diarrhoea are provided in Table 11.

For Exploratory objectives and endpoints, see Section 3 of the CSP. Overall Design This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, global study, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of capivasertib versus placebo, when added to abiraterone (+ prednisone/prednisolone) on a background of ADT in participants with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC characterised by PTEN deficiency.  PTEN status will be confirmed by investigational IHC testing of tumour tissue at central laboratories.  A participant cannot be randomised until a valid PTEN IHC result indicates PTEN deficiency.  Participants will be recruited globally from approximately 30 countries and approximately 350 study sites in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and Asia (including China and Japan). Participants will be randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive either capivasertib or matching placebo, in combination with abiraterone (+ prednisone/prednisolone) on a background of ADT.  The randomisation scheme will be stratified on the following factors: Combination of volume of disease according to CHAARTED criteria* and presence of visceral metastases** (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases/high volume disease without visceral metastases/low volume disease) * High volume (defined as the presence of visceral metastases or ≥ 4 bone lesions with ≥ 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis) versus low volume. ** For the purposes of this study, visceral metastases are defined by the list provided within the IWRS. Geographic location: North America, Western Europe, and Australia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and Asia. Disclosure Statement: This is a parallel-group treatment study with 2 arms that is participant, sponsor, and investigator blinded. Number of Participants: Approximately 5500 participants will be enrolled and screened to achieve a total of 1000 randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 treatment arms.  This is based on the planned number of 331 rPFS events that must be observed for the study to have 90% power to show a statistically significant difference in rPFS at the 2-sided 5% level, assuming a true treatment effect HR of 0.70 (see Section 9.2 for details). For regulatory submission purposes in China, the study will include approximately 150 randomised participants from sites in mainland China and those from Taiwan and Hong Kong accredited by the National Medical Product Administration (NMPA). Note: ‘Enrolled' means a participant's, or their legally acceptable representative's, agreement to participate in a clinical study following completion of the informed consent process.  Potential participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the study, but are not randomly assigned in the study, are considered ‘screen failures', unless otherwise specified by the protocol. Intervention Groups and Duration: Participants will receive oral treatment with capivasertib or matching placebo 400 mg twice daily (BD) 4 days on, 3 days off, until investigator-assessed disease progression by RECIST 1.1 or PCWG3 bone progression criteria, unacceptable toxicity, or the participant requests to stop the treatment.  Participants will also receive the approved oral dose of abiraterone (1000 mg once daily) with 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone daily.  All participants should also receive continuous ADT using either a LHRH agonist, a LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy. If either abiraterone or capivasertib/placebo is discontinued prior to disease progression, participants may remain on the other drug at the investigator's discretion until disease progression or evidence of unacceptable toxicity. Data Monitoring Committee: An independent Data Monitoring Committee will assess the progress of the study at regular intervals.  This will include reviewing unblinded safety and tolerability data and the data from the interim efficacy analysis to provide a recommendation to AstraZeneca as to whether the study should continue unchanged, be stopped, or be modified in any way. Statistical Methods: The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be used as the primary population for reporting efficacy data and to summarise baseline characteristics.  This comprises all participants randomised into the study and will be analysed according to randomised treatment regardless of the treatment received (ITT principle).  Any important deviations from randomised treatment will be listed and considered when interpreting the efficacy data.  The Safety Analysis Set will be used as the primary population for reporting safety data.  This comprises all participants randomised into the study who receive at least 1 dose of capivasertib or placebo and will be analysed according to the treatment received.  If a participant receives at least 1 dose of capivasertib they will be included in the capivasertib arm for safety summaries. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy, measured by rPFS, of capivasertib + abiraterone versus placebo + abiraterone, both groups receiving continuous ADT.  The primary endpoint is rPFS in participants who have de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC characterised by PTEN deficiency who have received no prior pharmacotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery for metastatic prostate cancer other than that which is permitted by the protocol and may have been administered for a maximum of 3 months from start of ADT to randomisation in the study.  The effect of capivasertib versus placebo will be tested using a log rank test stratified by the randomisation stratification factors.  If there are insufficient events per strata, some strata will be collapsed following rules to be pre-specified in the SAP.  From a stratified Cox proportional hazards model (ties = Efron) the HR (capivasertib + abiraterone versus placebo + abiraterone) together with its corresponding 95% CI will be presented.  A HR < 1 will favour capivasertib + abiraterone. The key secondary endpoints of OS, TFST, SSE-FS, and TTPP will be tested following a MTP to preserve the overall type 1 error (familywise error rate) in the strong sense.  Each endpoint will have its own alpha spending function and will be tested according to the group-sequential Holm variable (GSHv) procedure (Ye et al 2013).  TFST will be analysed at the rPFS interim and final analyses.  OS, SSE-FS, and TTPP will be analysed at the final rPFS analysis and again, approximately 12 months after the final rPFS analysis. The primary endpoint of rPFS (based on investigator assessment using RECIST version 1.1 [soft tissue] and PCWG3 [bone]) will be tested in an interim analysis after 222 (22% maturity) rPFS events have occurred.  With 222 events, a significant result will be declared if the observed rPFS HR is 0.593 or better at this interim analysis with a 2-sided p-value < 0.0001 (approximate relative information fraction = 67%).  The interim analysis on rPFS will be incorporated into the MTP including the key secondary endpoints, which will be analysed using the same methodology specified for the primary endpoint. When the final rPFS analysis is performed it is estimated that approximately 331 (33%) of the 1000 participants will have progressed, according to the definition of rPFS: the time from randomisation to radiographic progression assessed by investigator using RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and/or PCWG3 (bone) criteria, or death. Safety and tolerability data will be summarised using appropriate descriptive statistics. 1.2  Schema Figure 1  Study Design a  High volume is defined as the presence of visceral metastases or ≥ 4 bone lesions with ≥ 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis (Sweeney et al 2015).

Screening will be conducted in a 2-part process which must be completed within a 3-month period between the participant starting ADT and being randomised to study treatment.  This 3-month period may also include abiraterone treatment.  Screening Part 1 includes testing for PTEN status.  In Part 2, all remaining screening assessments should be performed, and must be completed within 28 days before randomisation.  Screening Part 1 and Part 2 each require a separate ICF.  Participants under screening in Part 2 must be given sufficient time to complete the 7-day BPI-SF and BFI diaries.  Table 2 provides the SoA for the study treatment and follow-up periods. Table 1  Schedule of Assessments (Screening) Screening Part 1 None  1  Schedule of Assessments (Screening) Screening Part 1 a Initial eligibility criteria review for all criteria marked with * in Section 5.1 (inclusion criteria) and Section 5.2 (exclusion criteria). b Bidimensional echocardiogram is the preferred modality because of the global technetium [Tc-99m] shortage (but MUGA can be used alternatively).  The modality of the cardiac function assessments must be consistent within subject ie, if echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment and a follow-up assessment if clinically indicated, then echocardiogram should also be used for subsequent scans.  Participants should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible. c Participants will be required to provide the most recently collected tumour sample (bone metastases or Fine Needle Aspirate [FNA] samples will not be accepted), collected as part of routine clinical practice.  Availability of a tumour sample is mandatory for all patients to enrol in the study for the determination of PTEN status by IHC.  A representative FFPE tissue block that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides must be provided, or, if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual and Pathology Testing Manual.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1; no additional slides will be collected for screening Part 1 or Part 2. d Optional tumour sample: FFPE block (preferred) or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections can be provided.  These slides will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and/ or diagnostic test development.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual and Pathology Testing Manual. e Not applicable for China participants. f Eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) are required to provide an additional tumour sample FFPE block (preferred) or 20 (minimum 15) freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  This sample will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and/or diagnostic test development.  Patients who provided optional tissue in screening Part 1 are exempt from this requirement.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. g Blood sample for determination of PSA.  Mandatory for all participants on study.  Samples to be collected both at screening and at Cycle 1, Day 1. h Tumour assessment will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a whole-body bone scan.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before randomisation, and ideally should be performed as close as possible to the start of study treatment. i BPI-SF and BFI baseline assessments to be completed by the participant in a consecutive 7-day period during screening (only after PTEN deficiency is confirmed) before randomisation (not required to be at site). j In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs/SAEs must be reported.

Cycle (4-week cycles) Cycle (4-week cycles) Cycle (4-week cycles) a Participants will receive the capivasertib recommended oral dose (400 mg twice daily on intermittent schedule [4 days on/3 days off]) or placebo until disease progression or discontinuation. b Participants will also receive the approved dose of abiraterone (1000 mg) as a single oral daily dose on each day of each cycle with 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone once daily, until disease progression or discontinuation. c Bidimensional echocardiogram is the preferred modality because of the global technetium [Tc-99m] shortage (but MUGA can be used alternatively).  The modality of the cardiac function assessments must be consistent within participant, ie, if echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment and a follow-up assessment if clinically indicated, then echocardiogram should also be used for subsequent scans.  Participants should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible. d Cycle (4-week cycles) In accordance with the abiraterone prescribing information, serum transaminase levels should continue to be measured monthly throughout treatment with abiraterone (ie, measured at every cycle until discontinuation of abiraterone treatment). e Blood sample for determination of PSA.  Mandatory for all participants on study.  Samples to be collected at screening and C1D1.  PSA progression should be confirmed with a consecutive PSA assessment at least 3 weeks later after each sample collection. f Not applicable for China participants. g Whole blood samples collected for CellSearch CTC assay at pre-treatment on C1D1, pre-treatment on C4D1, and at disease progression. h Whole blood samples collected for EPIC Sciences CTC assay pre-treatment on C1D1, and at disease progression. i Optional matched paired tumour biopsy samples will be collected from consented participants.  A baseline biopsy taken before the initial dosing of study drugs pre-dose on C1D1 (or up to 7 days before C1D1) and an on-treatment biopsy taken between C1D16 and C1D18. j Where possible and with consent, participants may be requested to provide a tumour biopsy at tumour progression. k Tumour assessment will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a whole-body bone scan.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (± 14 days) relative to the date of randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), regardless of discontinuation of study treatment (eg, discontinuation due to toxicity or clinical progression) or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy.  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged.  If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at the participant's scheduled visits.  It is important to follow the imaging assessment schedule as closely as possible; however, tumour assessment can be performed at any time when disease progression is clinically suspected.  For participants who have at least 2 new bone lesions appearing on the first post-baseline scan, confirmation of progression will be required by an additional bone scan showing 2 or more new lesions compared to the first post-baseline bone scan at least 6 weeks later (for further detail please see Appendix E). l For the BPI-SF and BFI, the C1D1 assessment is part of the 7-day diaries completed at screening (see Table 1). m The PRO-CTCAE will only be administered where a linguistically validated version exists for a country. n In addition to regular contacts at 12-week intervals, participants will be contacted in the 7 days following a specified date (data cut-off date) for survival analysis. o Participants will enter the PFS2 follow-up period once the participant has discontinued study treatment due to progressive disease by RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue lesions and/or PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions.  In the survival follow-up period following PFS, all subsequent cancer therapies and vital status will be documented at least every 12 weeks until death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first.

          "AdverseEvents": "8.3.8.  Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for belantamab mafodotin are corneal events, thrombocytopenia and infusion-related reactions.  Severity of all AESI will be graded using National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCICTCAE, v5.0).  Guidelines for dose modifications and interruptions for management of common toxicities associated with the study treatment(s) are provided in Section 6.6.  Dose modifications for belantamab mafodotin corneal events will be based on the CTCAE criteria for eye disorders in Table 29.",
          "SeriousAdverseEvents": "8.3.  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Section 10.2. The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study intervention or the study, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention (Section 7). 8.3.1.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information All SAEs will be collected from the start of study treatment until at least 70 days after discontinuing all study interventions regardless of initiation of a new cancer therapy or transfer to hospice, at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 1.3).  However, any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., study intervention, protocolmandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to a GSK product will be recorded from the from the time a participant consents to participate in the study up to and including any follow-up. All AEs will be collected from the start of treatment until at least 70 days following discontinuation of study treatment regardless of initiation of a new cancer therapy or transfer to hospice at the time points specified in the SoA. Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the case report form (CRF) not the AE section. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Section 10.2.  The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after the conclusion of the study participation.  However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.2. 8.3.2.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.2. Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE.  Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. 8.3.3.  Follow-up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  All SAEs, and non-serious AEs of special interest (as defined in Section 8.3.8), will be followed until the event is resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.3).  Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Section 10.2. 8.3.4.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor or designee of an SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor or designee has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation.  The sponsor or designee will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor or designee will review and then file it along with the Investigator's Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 8.3.5.  Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies will be collected after the start of study treatment and for 9 months following the last dose of belantamab mafodotin (Arm A) and 7 months following the last dose of bortezomib (Arm B). Details of pregnancies from female partners of male participants will be collected after the start of study treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of belantamab mafodotin (Arm A) and 4 months following the last dose of bortezomib (Arm B). If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator must inform GSK or designee within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and must follow the procedures outlined in Section 10.3. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, and ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAE. 8.3.6.  Cardiovascular and Death Events The Death CRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported.  Initial and follow-up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. For any cardiovascular events detailed in Section 10.2.3, whether or not they are considered SAEs, and all deaths, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the CRF will be required to be completed.  These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non-cardiovascular death. The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms.  The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the CRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. 8.3.7. Disease-Related Events and/or Disease-Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as SAEs Disease progression does not need to be reported as a serious adverse event (SAE).  However, if the underlying disease (i.e., progression) is greater than that which would normally be expected for the participant, or if the investigator considers that there was a causal relationship between treatment with study treatment(s) or protocol design or procedures and the disease progression, then this must be reported as an SAE. Death due to the disease under study is to be recorded on the Death eCRF. 8.3.8.  Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for belantamab mafodotin are corneal events, thrombocytopenia and infusion-related reactions.  Severity of all AESI will be graded using National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCICTCAE, v5.0).  Guidelines for dose modifications and interruptions for management of common toxicities associated with the study treatment(s) are provided in Section 6.6.  Dose modifications for belantamab mafodotin corneal events will be based on the CTCAE criteria for eye disorders in Table 29.",

Synopsis Protocol Title: A Phase III, Multicenter, Open-Label, Randomized Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Belantamab Mafodotin in Combination with Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone (B-Pd) versus Pomalidomide, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone (PVd) in Participants with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (DREAMM 8) Short Title: A Phase III Study of Belantamab Mafodotin plus Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone vs Pomalidomide, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone in Participants with RRMM Rationale: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by the clonal proliferation of plasma cells.   A variety of drugs and combination treatments have been evaluated and were found effective in treating MM.   These include immunomodulatory agents and proteasome inhibitors (PIs) that form the backbone of treatment regimens across all treatment lines. The treatment paradigm of relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) is rapidly evolving with an increasing use of lenalidomide-based therapy as frontline treatment and pomalidomide in subsequent lines of therapy.   Pomalidomide, an immunomodulatory imide drug (IMiD) with a similar structure to thalidomide and lenalidomide that binds to cereblon (CRBN), is approved when administered with low-dose dexamethasone (Pd) in the US, EU and a number of other countries worldwide for patients with RRMM who have received at least 2 prior therapies, including both lenalidomide and bortezomib and have demonstrated disease progression on their last therapy.   The Pd combination improved median progression-free survival (mPFS) for about 2 months over dexamethasone alone in patients with lenalidomide-resistant MM (4.0 vs.  1.9; HR 0.49; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.61; p<0.001).   The combination regimens of daratumumab or elotuzumab with Pd were also approved in the US for RRMM in patients who have been previously treated with at least 2 prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor. With the increasing use of lenalidomide in first-line either in combination with other antimyeloma drugs or as maintenance therapy after autologous stem cell transplant, pomalidomide is also emerging as a second-line regimen for the treatment of RRMM.  The combination of pomalidomide with twice-weekly bortezomib injected subcutaneously (SC) and low-dose dexamethasone (PVd) given in 21-day cycles (q3w) showed significantly improved clinical activity in a randomized Phase III trial (OPTIMISMM Study, N=559) in patients previously treated with lenalidomide and 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy.  PVd reduced the risk of progression and death by 39% compared with bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd) (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49-0.77, p<0.0001) with a mPFS of 11.2 (vs.  7.1) months and an overall response rate (ORR) of 82% (vs.  50%), including 15.7% sCR/CR, 37% VGPR, and 29.5% PR. The safety profile was consistent with known toxicities associated with other immunomodulators, PIs, and dexamethasone combination regimens, mostly comprising myelosuppression, infections, and neuropathy.  Based on these findings, PVd has been approved by EMA for treatment of patients with at least 1 prior lines of therapy including lenolidomide.  It is anticipated that the combination of PVd will become a SoC option for second line treatment of RRMM in other countries/regions as well. Belantamab mafodotin is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that binds specifically to B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a target restricted to B cells at later stages of differentiation, and expressed on tumor cells of all patients with MM.   Efficacy and safety results from the first time in human (FTIH) Study BMA117159 (DREAMM-1) have demonstrated that belantamab mafodotin administered as single agent at the 3.4 mg/kg q3w has the potential to be an effective treatment option with a novel mechanism of action (MOA) for patients with RRMM.  However, a significant number of patients required dose delays and dose reductions to manage adverse events; most common adverse events include thrombocytopenia and corneal events. In the pivotal Phase II Study 205678 (DREAMM-2), belantamab mafodotin was further evaluated as monotherapy in RRMM patients at doses of 2.5 mg/kg and 3.4 mg/kg q3w and demonstrated meaningful clinical activity in patients with heavily pretreated RRMM.   While both 2.5 and 3.4 mg/kg dose levels have a positive benefit/risk profile, the 2.5 mg/kg dose had a lower incidence of adverse events, less frequent dose delays and reductions, and with similar efficacy as the 3.4 mg/kg dose as measured by ORR, and was therefore chosen as the dose to be evaluated in the confirmatory registrational study 207495 (DREAMM-3) evaluating belantamab mafodotin monotherapy (versus the combination of pomalidomide and dexamethasone) in patients with RRMM. Preclinical data with belantamab mafodotin suggest significant additive efficacy when combined with pomalidomide in two established MM xenograft models.   We hypothesize that the combination of belantamab mafodotin with Pd may result in significant additive or synergistic effects with acceptable toxicity profiles, establishing new global standard of care (SoC) regimens. Belantamab mafodotin at multiple dose levels in combination with Pd q4w is being evaluated for safety and efficacy in patients with RRMM in an ongoing Phase I/II study conducted by the Myeloma Canada Research Network (MCRN 007 or Study 209418). The present study is evaluating whether the combined activity of belantamab mafodotin at 2.5 mg/kg in Cycle 1 (C1) and 1.9 mg/kg in Cycle 2 onwards (C2+) when administered in combination with Pd could potentially translate into clinically meaningful benefits compared to PVd in RRMM participants who are progressing on or after treatment with a lenalidomide-containing regimen. Primary and Secondary Objectives and Endpoints: Objectives ADA = anti-drug antibodies; AE = adverse event; CR= Complete Response, DoR = duration of response; EORTC QLQ C30 = European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30-item Core module; EORTC IL52 = European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Item Library 52; HRQoL = health-related quality of life; ORR = overall response rate; OS = overall survival; PFS = progression-free survival; PR = partial response; PRO-CTCAE = Patient Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; RRMM = relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; sCR= Stringent Complete Response; TTBR = time to best response; TTP = time to progression; TTR = time to response; VGPR= Very Good Partial Response. Overall Design: This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of belantamab mafodotin in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (B-Pd) compared with pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (PVd) in participants with RRMM previously treated with lenalidomide and at least 1 prior line of therapy. Disclosure Statement: This study is a parallel group study with 2 treatment arms and no masking. Number of Participants: Approximately 560 participants in Phase III will be screened to achieve 450 participants randomized in a 1:1 ratio between the 2 arms.   There will be a 15% global enrollment cap on North East Asia Countries.  In these countries, respective regulatory authorities require a sufficient representation of their population to be included in marketing authorizations. Intervention Groups and Duration: Following screening, participants will be stratified based on the number of prior lines of therapy (1 vs.  2 and 3 vs. ≥4), prior bortezomib treatment (yes or no) and International Staging System (ISS) status (I vs.  II/III), and centrally randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Treatment Arm A or Treatment Arm B.  No more than 50% of participants with 2 or more prior lines of treatment will be enrolled.  It is anticipated that no more than 15% will be enrolled in with 4 or more prior lines of treatment.  No cross-over between 2 study arms will be allowed. Treatment Arm A (B-Pd): belantamab mafodotin 2.5 mg/kg in C1 and 1.9 mg/kg in C2+ (IV), pomalidomide 4 mg, and dexamethasone 40 mg, q4w In Treatment Arm A, belantamab mafodotin will be administered intravenously (IV) at a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg on Day 1 (D1) of Cycle 1 and 1.9 mg/kg in Cycle 2 and beyond (2+) of every 28-day cycle (q4w).  Pomalidomide will be taken orally 4 mg per day on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle.  Dexamethasone will be administered orally at a dose of 40 mg per day on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle.  For participants who are >75 years old or have comorbidities or are intolerant to dexamethasone 40 mg, dexamethasone may be administered at the lower dose of 20 mg in Arm A at the discretion of the investigator. Treatment Arm B (PVd): Pomalidomide 4 mg, bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2, and dexamethasone 20 mg, q3w In Treatment Arm B, pomalidomide will be administered orally at 4 mg daily on Days 1 to 14 of each 21-day cycle (q3w), with bortezomib injected subcutaneously (SC) at 1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each 21-day cycle for Cycles 1-8 (C1-8) and on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle for Cycle 9 and beyond (C9+).  Dexamethasone will be administered orally at a dose of 20 mg on the day of and day after bortezomib, q3w or on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 for C1-8, and then on Days 1, 2, 8, and 9 for C9+.  For participants who are >75 years old or have comorbidities or are intolerant to dexamethasone 20 mg, dexamethasone may be administered at the lower dose of 10 mg on the day of and day after bortezomib in Arm B at the discretion of the investigator. Treatment will continue in both arms until progressive disease, death, unacceptable toxicity, start of a new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or end of the study, whichever occurs first.   Dose delays or reductions may be required following potential drug-associated toxicities.   Participants will be followed for progressive disease (PD) and overall survival (OS). Data Monitoring Committee: Yes 1.2.  Study Schema * Stratification: Prior lines of treatment (1 vs.  2 and 3 vs. ≥4), prior bortezomib treatment (yes or no) and ISS status (I vs.  II/III). No more than 50% of participants with 2 or more prior lines of treatment will be enrolled.  It is anticipated that no more than 15% of participants will be enrolled with 4 or more prior lines of treatment.  No cross-over will be allowed. SC administration of bortezomib only Reduce the dose level of dexamethasone by half if age >75 years or have comorbidities or are intolerant to 40 mg dose in Arm A or 20 mg dose in Arm B, respectively. IV = intravenous; PD = progressive disease; PO = oral administration; RRMM = relapsed refractory multiple myeloma; SC = subcutaneous. 1.3.  Schedule of Activities (SoA) Table 1  Treatment Arm A - Belantamab Mafodotin/Pomalidomide/Dexamethasone Screening assessments do not need to be repeated on C1D1 if conducted within 72 hours of C1D1 dosing, unless otherwise specified.  Study treatment should be initiated within 72 hours after treatment allocation. Precise timing of treatment cycles may vary due to treatment delays, but participants must still visit for efficacy assessments regularly regardless of when they receive treatment.   The schedule for efficacy assessments is q4w.  These are referred to as ‘fixed visits' or ‘weeks visits' and should be scheduled from C1D1. Assessments scheduled on days of dosing should be done prior to drug administration unless otherwise specified.  All assessments should be carried out even if a participant is not dosed except for the following: vital signs, weight, pregnancy test, PK (with the exception of C2D1), and ADA. The End of Treatment (EOT) visit will occur within 30 days from the last cycle, or prior to initiation of new anti-MM treatment (whichever occurs first).  AEs and SAEs will be collected up to at least 70 days after the last dose, either via phone or a follow up visit. The Progression-free Survival (PFS) Follow-up Visit, (for participants who discontinue study treatment for a reason other than PD) should be conducted every 4 weeks (±3 days) until confirmed PD, death, start of a new anti-cancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or end of the study whichever occurs first. The Overall Survival (OS) Follow-up Visit will be performed in all participants who come off treatment completely.  Participants will be followed for survival and subsequent anti-cancer therapy by chart review, phone call, or any form of communication every 3 months (±14 days) until study ends.  Record the participant's survival status and whether subsequent treatment for disease was given. Participant does not need to attend the site.   An exception is participants who have ocular symptoms at EOT who will be followed up for ocular exams and OSDI questionnaire. Procedure Procedure Procedure Informed Consent Form must be signed before any study-specific assessments are performed. Physical exam assessments are listed in Section 8.2.1.  Physical exam must be within 72 hours prior to first dose of study drugs to be administered in that cycle. C1D1 ocular exam does not need to be repeated if within 28 days of screening exam. On treatment ocular exams to be performed q4w, prior to dosing, up to the 6th dose of belantamab mafodotin.   After the 6th dose of belantamab mafodotin, if there are no significant ocular symptoms or vision changes the frequency of ophthalmologic exams may be decreased to every 3 months until end of treatment.   In case of persistent or newly developed ocular symptoms or vision changes, participants will have further ophthalmologic exams, at least every cycle until resolution (to Grade 1 or baseline) or more frequently as clinically indicated by the eye care specialist.   Ocular exam may be performed up to 5 days prior to dosing.   See Section 8.2.6 and for full details of ocular exam procedures. Participants in PFS follow up will only have ocular exams if they had signs or symptoms at EOT or as clinically indicated. At the first dose of belantamab mafodotin, vital signs must be assessed within 30 min prior to Start of Infusion (SOI), 15 mins after SOI, (±10 min), within 15 min after End of Infusion (EOI), and at 1 h (±10 min) after EOI. On subsequent doses of belantamab mafodotin, vital signs must be assessed within 30 minutes prior to SOI and within 15 min after EOI. Vital signs should be measured after resting for at least 5 minutes.   On days when vital sign time points align with blood sampling time points, it is recommended that vital signs be assessed prior to blood samples being drawn.  On days when vital signs are measured multiple times, temperature does not need to be repeated unless clinically indicated. Hematology and vital signs must be repeated prior to each dose of belantamab mafodotin treatment. Single ECG on screening, unless QTcF is prolonged, in which case triplicate ECGs are required. All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study and up to at least 70 days after the last dose of study treatment should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline, refer to Table 16 for a comprehensive list of lab tests.  If labs are completed within 72 hours prior to the first dose, this assessment need not be repeated on C1D1. Hematology labs (CBC) and clinical chemistry should be performed weekly for the first 2 cycles (i.e.  D 1, 8, 15, 22 for 8 weeks) and as clinical indicated; thereafter, CBC and clinical chemistry labs should be performed on D1 and D15 of every 28-day cycle for C3+ and prior to every belantamab mafodotin administration.  Testing may be performed up to 72 hours prior to administration of study treatment.  Results must be evaluated prior to treatment administration. eGFR as calculated by Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula (Section 10.7). Urine dipstick may be used to assess for presence of urine protein.  Albumin/creatinine ratio needs to be done in any participant with urine dipstick result of >1+ at Screening or >2+ on treatment, or with positive protein if urine dipstick protein quantification is not available.  Albumin/creatinine will be performed at a local lab. If local testing is not available, then central testing will be performed (first void). Hepatitis C RNA testing will be done to determine participant eligibility if hepatitis C antibody-positive.   This will be performed at a local lab or, if not available, then at a central lab. Perform only in women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), see Appendix 3 for definition.  A serum pregnancy test must be performed at screening.  Two negative serum pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating treatment; the first test should be performed within 10-14 days of C1D1, but the second must be performed within 24 hours of C1D1.  After the first dose, pregnancy test will be done weekly during the first month, then every cycle thereafter (or every 2 weeks in females with irregular menstrual cycles).  Subsequent pregnancy test on dosing days may be either serum or urine test. Each pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior to dosing.  Final pregnancy test (serum or urine) must be performed in WOCBP at the EOT visit (at least 70 days after last dose) and at 2 weeks (in case of irregular menses) and 4 weeks following treatment discontinuation.   Follow up pregnancy assessment by telephone (for WOCBP only) should be performed 9 months after the last dose of belantamab mafodotin. Only in participants with IgD/IgE myeloma. Imaging is only required for participants with extramedullary disease by either CT, MRI, or PET/CT.   Screening assessment may be performed up to 30 days prior to C1D1.   Subsequently imaging should be performed every 12 weeks within the first 12 months (at Weeks 13, 25, 37, 49 7 days); thereafter only if clinically indicated, per local guidance.  The same modality should be used throughout the study as was done at baseline.  Selected target lesion should be measured and followed over time.  Plasmacytoma measurements should be taken from the CT portion of the PET/CT, or MRI scans, or dedicated CT scans where applicable.  For participants with only skin involvement, skin lesions should be measured with a ruler.  Measurement of tumor size will be determined by the sum of the products of the maximal perpendicular diameters of measured lesions (SPD).  Imaging for extramedullary disease will be collected and stored by a central vendor. Participants undergoing PET/CT should have all blood samples taken before the PET/CT is performed. For participants with PD due to extramedullary disease, confirmation scans are not required.   The laboratory parameters do not need to be repeated if the extra medullary disease is the only site of progression.   If the last radiographic assessment occurred ≥8 weeks prior to the participant's withdrawal from study treatment, and PD has NOT been documented, a new assessment for extramedullary disease should be obtained at EOT.  If participant continues in PFS follow-up, perform scans for extramedullary disease as clinically indicated Imaging of bones for lytic lesions by method aligned with institutional guidance (i.e., X-ray, CT, or MRI).  Survey results within 30 days prior to C1D1 date are acceptable.  At later cycles, repeat as clinically indicated, or if worsening clinical symptoms suggest PD, by the same method used as at screening. Response to treatment will be assessed q4w (±3 days) regardless of dosing, based on laboratory tests and imaging (if applicable), using IMWG criteria [Kumar, 2016]. Belantamab mafodotin 2.5mg/kg will be administered on Day 1 of every 28-day cycle  as an IV infusion over at least 30 min (see SRM for details).  A window of ±3 days is acceptable for administration of study treatment after C1D1.  Refer to Section 6.6.1 and Section 6.7.1for instructions on dose delays and dose modification guidelines. Pomalidomide 4 mg PO daily on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle to be taken after the 1hr rest period after belantamab mafodotin.  Platelet count must be ≥50,000 per L to initiate new cycle.  Refer to Section 6.6.1 and Section 6.7.1 for instructions on dose delays and dose modification guidelines. Dexamethasone 40 mg PO on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of every 28-day cycle.  For participants who are >75 years or have comorbidities or are intolerant to 40 mg, the dose of dexamethasone can be reduced to 20 mg in Arm A.  Refer to Section 6.6.1 and Section 6.7.1for instructions on dose delays and dose modification guidelines. On days where only pomalidomide and dexamethasone are taken at home, they should be taken in the morning approximately at the same time each day.  On belantamab mafodotin dosing days, dexamethasone should be administered 1-3 hours prior to the first administration of belantamab mafodotin. Participant diaries will be used to keep a record of self-administered oral study treatment(s) at home. PRO-CTCAE, EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC IL52, FACT-GP5, PGIS, and PGIC, should be collected q4w regardless of treatment, and at EOT.  EQ-5D should be collected q8w regardless of treatment, and at EOT  All PROs should be administered prior to any assessments being performed and prior to results being provided to the participant.  PRO collection will start at C1D1 with the exception of the PGIC which will start at Week 5. EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC IL52, EQ-5D-3L, PGIS, and PGIC will be administered every 8 weeks after end of treatment whilst in PFS follow-up. EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC IL52 and EQ-5D-3L should be administered at 3, 6 and 12 months in the OS follow-up.  For participants in OS follow-up not attending the site, they can be administered via a phone call in an interview format. OSDI should be collected prior to any treatment administration on C1D1, then q4w up to the 6th dose of belantamab mafodotin then q8w until EOT.  Participants in Arm A with no ocular signs at the EOT ocular assessment will have no further OSDI collection.  Participants in Arm A with ocular signs at the EOT ocular assessment will have OSDI collected q12w until resolution to Grade 1 or baseline or more frequently as clinically indicated by the eye care specialist.  For participants in OS follow-up not attending the site, they can be administered via a phone call in an interview format.

          "AdverseEvents": "Reporting of serious adverse events All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IPs or to the study procedure(s).   All SAEs, including supporting data, will be recorded in the eCRF. If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators or other site personnel should inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately.   Investigators or other site personnel should inform AstraZeneca representatives (and enter into the eCRF) of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within 1 calendar day, ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate that an AE is serious in the WBDC system, an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigators or other study site personnel reports an SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the Investigators/study site personnel how to proceed. The reference documents for definition of expectedness/listedness are the IBs for MEDI4736 and tremelimumab.

          "Endpoints": "Secondary endpoints Proportion of patients alive at 24 months The OS24 will be defined as the Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS at 24 months. Proportion of patients alive and progression free at 12 months The APF12 will be defined as the Kaplan-Meier estimate of PFS (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the BICR) at 12 months. Objective response rate ORR (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR) is defined as the number (%) of patients with at least 1 visit response of CR or PR and will be based on a subset of all randomized patients.   The denominator is a subset of the ITT population who has measurable disease at Baseline.   Therefore, data obtained up until progression, or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, will be included in the assessment of ORR.   Patients who go off treatment without progression receive a subsequent therapy, and then respond will not be included as responders in the ORR. Duration of response DoR (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR) will be defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the first date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression.   The end of response should coincide with the date of progression or death from any cause used for the RECIST 1.1 PFS endpoint. The time of the initial response will be defined as the latest of the dates contributing towards the first visit response of CR or PR.  If a patient does not progress following a response, then their DoR will be censored at the PFS censoring time.   DoR will not be defined for those patients who do not have documented response. Disease control rate DCR at 3 or 12 months is defined as the percentage of patients who have a best objective response (BoR) of CR or PR in the first 3 or 12 months, respectively, or who have demonstrated SD for a minimum interval of 12 or 48 weeks, respectively (-7 days, ie, 77 or 329 days, respectively), following the start of study treatment. DCR will be determined programmatically based on RECIST 1.1 using BICR data and all data up until the first progression event.   This will use all data up until the progression event that is used for the analysis. Time from randomization to second progression PFS2 will be defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest of the progression event subsequent to that used for the PFS endpoint or death.   The date of second progression will be recorded by the Investigator in the eCRF and defined according to local standard clinical practice and may involve any of the following: objective radiological imaging, symptomatic progression, or death.   Second progression status will be reviewed (every 8 weeks relative to the date of randomization) following the progression event used for the primary variable PFS (the first progression) and status recorded.   Patients alive and for whom a second disease progression has not been observed should be censored at the last time known to be alive and without a second disease progression, that is, censored at the latest of the PFS or PFS2 assessment date if the patient has not had a second progression or death. Best objective response BoR is calculated based on the overall visit responses from each RECIST assessment, described in Appendix E.   It is the best response a patient has had during their time in the study up until RECIST progression (or confirmed disease progression where applicable) or the last evaluable assessment in the absence of RECIST progression. Categorization of BoR will be based on RECIST (Appendix E) using the following response categories: CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE. BoR will be determined programmatically based on RECIST using all BICR data up until the first progression event. For patients whose progression event is death, BoR will be calculated based upon all evaluable RECIST assessments prior to death. For patients who die with no evaluable RECIST assessments, if the death occurs ≤17 weeks (ie, 16 weeks ±7 days) after randomization, then BoR will be assigned to the PD category. For patients who die with no evaluable RECIST assessments, if the death occurs >17 weeks (ie, 16 weeks ±7 days) after randomization, then BoR will be assigned to the NE category. Progression events that have been censored due to them being >17 weeks after the last evaluable assessment will not contribute to the BoR derivation.",

Duration of treatment, criteria for retreatment, and treatment through progression Duration of treatment Patients randomized to the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy and the MEDI4736 monotherapy arms will begin treatment on Day 1 until progressive disease (PD) is confirmed, unacceptable toxicity occurs, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met.   According to RECIST 1.1 modified for confirmation of progression, a confirmatory scan will be required following an overall timepoint assessment of progression, preferably at the next scheduled visit and no earlier than 4 weeks after the previous assessment of PD. Patients randomized to treatment in the SoC arm (cisplatin + gemcitabine or carboplatin + gemcitabine) will begin treatment on Day 1 for up to 6 cycles until the first assessment of disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met.   A confirmatory scan will not be required if PD is identified on the SoC arm in order to discontinue treatment; however, a confirmatory scan is required following an overall timepoint assessment of initial progression, even if a subsequent treatment is started, and no earlier than 4 weeks after the previous assessment of PD. Retreatment Patients randomized to the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy arm who meet the retreatment criteria (described below) may receive retreatment 1 time at the Investigator's discretion.  During retreatment, patients will follow the same schedule of assessments as the original treatment period (with the exception of the pharmacokinetics and anti-drug antibody assessments, which do not need to be collected a second time): Patients who complete the 4 dosing cycles of the combination of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab portion of the regimen (with clinical benefit per Investigator judgment) but subsequently have evidence of PD during the durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy portion of the combination regimen, with or without confirmation according to RECIST 1.1, may restart treatment with the combination. Patients who restart treatment after PD must have a baseline tumor assessment within 28 days of restarting treatment with MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy; all further scans will occur q8w (±7 days) relative to the date of randomization until disease progression Criteria for retreatment and treatment through progression Treatment through progression in either the MEDI4736 monotherapy arm, the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy arm, or retreatment in the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy arm are at the Investigator's discretion.  The Investigator will ensure that patients do not have any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible toxicities that indicate that continuing treatment will not provide further benefit to patients.  Moreover, these patients must meet the following specific criteria for treatment in the setting of PD: Written informed consent for retreatment and/or treatment through progression in the setting of PD will specify that treatment beyond evidence of PD is not the SoC and that alternative treatment options, including either locally licensed treatments or other clinical trials, are available for this patient population Absence of clinical symptoms or signs (including worsening of laboratory values [eg, new or worsening hypercalcemia]) indicating clinically significant disease progression and no decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status that can be attributed to disease progression Absence of rapid disease progression or threat to vital organs or critical anatomical sites (eg, central nervous system metastasis or respiratory failure due to tumor compression or spinal cord compression) that cannot be managed by protocol-allowed medical interventions However, a patient in the MEDI4736 monotherapy arm with confirmed disease progression will not be permitted to continue therapy with MEDI4736 if disease progression occurred after confirmed response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR], as defined by RECIST 1.1) in the target lesions.  Additionally, a patient in the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination treatment arm with confirmed disease progression during the combination portion of therapy that occurred after confirmed response (CR or PR, as defined by RECIST 1.1), will not be permitted to continue immunotherapy if disease progression occurred in the target lesions that previously responded to immunotherapy. Retreatment is not permitted for patients in the SoC arm. Patients whom AstraZeneca and the Investigator determine may not continue treatment after PD will enter follow-up.   All patients who have discontinued treatment due to toxicity or symptomatic deterioration, or who have commenced subsequent anticancer therapy, will be followed up until confirmed disease progression and for survival. Investigational product, dosage, and mode of administration MEDI4736 monotherapy MEDI4736 1.5 g via IV infusion q4w, starting on Week 0 MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy MEDI4736 (1.5 g via IV infusion q4w) over a 1-hour period in combination with tremelimumab (75 mg IV q4w) over a 1-hour period for up to 4 doses/cycle each, followed by MEDI4736 (1.5 g IV q4w) until confirmed progression or until other discontinuation criteria are met.   The first MEDI4736 monotherapy dose (1.5 g IV q4w) will be administered 4 weeks after the final dose of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab. Tremelimumab will be administered first; the MEDI4736 infusion will start approximately 1 hour after the end of the tremelimumab infusion.   If there are no clinically significant concerns after the first cycle, then, at the discretion of the Investigator, all other cycles of MEDI4736 can be given immediately after the tremelimumab infusion has finished. SoC Patients eligible for cisplatin will receive 1 of 2 gemcitabine + cisplatin options: IV infusions of cisplatin 70 mg/m2 on Day 2 of each 28-day cycle + gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle, for up to 6 cycles or IV infusions of cisplatin 70 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle + gemcitabine 1000 to 1250 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle, for up 6 cycles Patients in the SoC arm who are ineligible for cisplatin will receive IV infusions of carboplatin with an area under the curve (AUC) of 4.5 to 5 (AUC 4 is permitted only if required by local standard clinical practice) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle + gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle, for up to 6 cycles. Statistical methods The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with unresectable Stage IV urothelial cancer (UC) and to assess the efficacy of MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC in terms of OS in patients with unresectable Stage IV PD-L1-High UC. PFS (per RECIST 1.1, using Blinded Independent Central Review [BICR] assessments) will be defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of first objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdraws from randomized therapy or receives another anticancer therapy prior to progression.   OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause.   Thus, the co-primary endpoints of this study are PFS and OS in patients with UC and OS in patients with unresectable Stage IV PD-L1-High UC.   To control Type I error, the 5% alpha will be split into significance levels of 1%, 1.5%, and 2.5% and will be used for the analysis of PFS and OS in patients with UC and OS in patients with PD-L1-High UC, respectively.   The study will be considered positive (a success) if either the PFS analysis results or the OS analysis results in the all-comers or PD-L1-High population are statistically significant. Secondary efficacy analyses include PFS for MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC in patients with PD-L1-High UC; PFS and OS for MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC in patients with UC; PFS and OS for MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC in patients with PD-L1-Low/Neg UC; PFS and OS for MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus MEDI4736 monotherapy in patients with PD-L1-Low/Neg UC and all patients with UC, and PFS and OS for MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC in patients with PD-L1-High UC as well as the proportion of patients alive at 24 months from randomization; proportion of patients alive and progression-free at 12 months from randomization; and objective response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, and time from randomization to second progression for the above comparisons.   All tumor assessment-related endpoints will be assessed by BICR.   The PFS time will always be derived based on scan/assessment dates and not visit dates. Efficacy data will be summarized and analyzed on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis, and the treatment arms will be compared on the basis of randomized treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received.   Patients who were randomized but did not subsequently go on to receive study treatment are included in the ITT population. Approximately 1005 patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy, MEDI4736 monotherapy, or SoC.  The randomization will be stratified according to cisplatin eligibility (eligible or ineligible), PD-L1 status (High and/or Low/Neg), and visceral metastases (presence or absence of lung and/or liver metastasis).   PD-L1 status stratification will be based on natural prevalence rates.   Randomization of cisplatin-eligible patients will be capped at a maximum 85% of the planned total number of patients. The final analysis of PFS will be performed when Approximately 474 PFS events (71% maturity) have occurred across the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy and SoC treatment arms The final analysis of OS will be performed when both of the following are met: Approximately 519 OS events (77% maturity) have occurred across the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy and SoC treatment arms AND Approximately 306 OS events (76% maturity) have occurred in PD-L1-High UC patients treated across the MEDI4736 monotherapy and SoC treatment arms For the co-primary OS endpoint in the ITT population (MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC), 2 interim analyses will also be undertaken, and the interim analyses for OS endpoint in the PD-L1-High population (MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC) will be conducted at the same time: The first OS interim analysis will be conducted at the time of primary PFS analysis.   It is anticipated that approximately 70% of the target death events may occur in the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy and SoC treatment arms. The second OS interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 80% (415/519) of deaths, with the primary OS analysis performed when 519 deaths have accumulated. For the co-primary OS endpoint in the ITT population (MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC), if exactly 70% and 80% of the target events are available at the time of the first and second interim analyses, respectively (ie, 364/519 and 415/519 deaths have occurred), with an overall 2-sided alpha level of 1.5%, the 2-sided alpha to be applied at the OS interim analyses would be 0.28% and 0.48%, and the 2-sided alpha to be applied for the primary OS analysis would be 1.32%. For the co-primary OS endpoint in the PD-L1-High population (MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC), if exactly 70% and 80% of the target events are available at the time of the first and second interim analyses, respectively (ie, 214/306 and 244/306 deaths have occurred), with an overall 2-sided alpha level of 2.5%, the 2-sided alpha to be applied at the OS interim analyses would be 0.57% and 0.88%, and the 2-sided alpha to be applied for the primary OS analysis would be 2.16%. MEDI4736 + tremelimumab versus SoC (PFS in all-comers UC) If PFS at 12 months was 40% with MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy (with 9.7-month median PFS) and 27% with SoC (with 7.32-month median PFS) and assuming the true average PFS hazard ratio (HR) is 0.70, then the trial will have at least 90% power to demonstrate statistical significance at the 1% level (using a 2-sided test) for the comparison of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC, with the smallest treatment difference that could be statistically significant being an average HR of 0.79.   With a 16-month recruitment period and a minimum follow-up period of 11 months assumed, it is anticipated that this analysis will be performed 27 months after the first patient has been randomized. MEDI4736 + tremelimumab versus SoC (OS in all-comers UC) If OS at 12 months was 60% with MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy (with 17.1-month median OS) and 50% with SoC (with 12.02-month median OS) and assuming the true average OS HR is 0.72, then the trial will have at least 90% power to demonstrate statistical significance at a 2-sided alpha level of 1.32% (with overall alpha for OS of 1.5%) for the comparison of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC, with the smallest treatment difference that could be statistically significant being an average HR of 0.80.   With a 16-month recruitment period and a minimum follow-up period of 28 months assumed, it is anticipated that this analysis will be performed approximately 44 months after the first patient has been randomized. MEDI4736 versus SoC (OS in PD-L1-High UC) If OS at 12 months was 62% with MEDI4736 monotherapy and 50% with SoC (with 12.02-month median OS) and assuming the true average OS HR is 0.66, then the trial will have at least 90% power to demonstrate statistical significance at a 2-sided alpha level of 2.16% (with overall alpha for OS of 2.5%) for the comparison of MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC, with the smallest treatment difference that could be statistically significant being an average HR of 0.77.   With a 16-month recruitment period and a minimum follow-up period of 28 months assumed, it is anticipated that this analysis will be performed approximately 44 months after the first patient has been randomized. MEDI4736 versus SoC (PFS in PD-L1-High UC) If PFS at 12 months was 40% with MEDI4736 monotherapy (with 10.3-month median PFS) and PFS on the control arm is assumed to be the same regardless of PD-L1 status and assuming the true average PFS HR is 0.65, then the trial will have at least 90% power to demonstrate statistical significance at the 1% level (using a 2-sided test) for the comparison of MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC, with the smallest treatment difference that could be statistically significant being an average HR of 0.73.   With a 16-month recruitment period and a minimum follow-up period of 11 months assumed, it is anticipated that this analysis will be performed approximately 27 months after the first patient has been randomized. PFS, based on the programmatically derived RECIST 1.1 from BICR assessments, and OS will be analyzed using a stratified log-rank test (stratified for cisplatin eligibility [ie, eligible or ineligible], PD-L1 expression tumor status [High or Low/Neg, for analysis in the ITT population only], and visceral metastasis [presence or absence of lung and/or liver metastasis]).   The effect of treatment will be estimated by the HR together with corresponding ([1-adjusted alpha] × 100%) confidence intervals and p-values for PFS and OS, respectively. Descriptive statistics will be used for all variables, as appropriate, and will be presented by treatment arm. Safety data Data from all cycles of treatment will be combined in the presentation of safety data.   Adverse events (AEs; both in terms of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms and CTCAE grade) will be listed individually by patient.   The number of patients experiencing each AE will be summarized by treatment arm and CTCAE grade.   If there are too few events available for a meaningful analysis of a particular subgroup (it is not considered appropriate to present analyses where there are less than 20 events in a subgroup), the relationship between that subgroup and PFS will be summarized descriptively and will not be formally analyzed  Other safety data will be assessed in terms of physical examination, clinical chemistry, hematology, vital signs, and electrocardiograms.   At the end of the study, appropriate summaries of all safety data will be produced, as defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

          "AdverseEvents": "Other significant adverse events During the evaluation of the AE data, an AstraZeneca medically qualified expert will review the list of AEs that were not reported as SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation.   Based on the expert's judgment, significant AEs of particular clinical importance may, after consultation with the Global Patient Safety Physician, be considered other significant adverse events (OAEs) and reported as such in the CSR.   A similar review of laboratory/vital signs/ECG data will be performed for identification of OAEs.   Examples of these are marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities, and certain events that lead to intervention (other than those already classified as serious) or significant additional treatment.",
          "SeriousAdverseEvents": "Reporting of serious adverse events All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IPs or to the study procedure(s).   All SAEs, including supporting data, will be recorded in the eCRF. If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators or other site personnel should inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately.   Investigators or other site personnel should inform AstraZeneca representatives (and enter into the eCRF) of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within 1 calendar day, ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate that an AE is serious in the WBDC system, an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigators or other study site personnel reports an SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the Investigators/study site personnel how to proceed. The reference documents for definition of expectedness/listedness are the IBs for MEDI4736 and tremelimumab. The PI is responsible for ensuring that procedures and expertise are available to handle medical emergencies during the study.   A medical emergency usually constitutes an SAE and is to be reported as such.",
          "Endpoints": "Interim analysis of overall survival endpoints The two interim analyses of OS will be carried out for superiority: The first interim analysis will be conducted at the time when approximately 80% of the final OS analysis events have occurred across the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy and SoC treatment arms (440 events, 66% maturity); AND across the MEDI4736 monotherapy and SoC treatment arms in PD-L1 High population (262 events, 65% maturity), projected approximately 16 months after the last patient being randomized. The second interim analysis of OS will be conducted when approximately 90% of the final OS analysis events have occurred across the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy and SoC treatment arms(495 events, 74% maturity); AND across the MEDI4736 monotherapy and SoC treatment arms in PD-L1 High population (294 events, 73% maturity), projected approximately 21 months after the last patient being randomized. These analyses will be assessed by an IDMC.   Details of the plan and communication process will be provided in the statistical analysis plan and the IDMC charter. The criterion for superiority in the OS co-primary endpoint is a statistically significant improvement in OS.   The alpha level that is to be spent at the interim and final analyses for the OS analyses in the ITT population and PD-L1-High population will be calculated using the Lan DeMets spending function separately. For the co-primary OS endpoint in the ITT population (MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC), if exactly 80% and 90% of the target events are available at the time of the first and second interim analyses, respectively (ie, 440/550 and 495/550 deaths have occurred), with an overall 2-sided alpha level of 1.5%, the 2-sided alpha to be applied at the OS interim analyses would be 0.56% and 0.8%, and the 2-sided alpha to be applied for the primary OS analysis would be 1.19%. For the co-primary OS endpoint in the PD-L1-High population (MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC), if exactly 80% and 90% of the target events are available at the time of the first and second interim analyses, respectively (ie, 262/327 and 294/327 deaths have occurred), with an overall 2-sided alpha level of 3.5%, the 2-sided alpha to be applied at the OS interim analyses would be 1.58% and 2.01%, and the 2-sided alpha to be applied for the primary OS analysis would be 2.71%. If the interim analyses indicate superiority, then subsequent analyses of the further secondary endpoints will be performed in accordance with the hierarchical multiple testing strategy.   If the interim results do not meet the criterion of stopping for superiority, then follow-up will continue until final OS analysis.",

Therefore, approximately 335 patients will be randomized to each of the treatment arms.  Closing of global cohort enrollment will be defined as closing recruitment across all sites except for those located in China.  The global ITT population will include all patients randomized into global cohort.  Once global enrollment has ended, recruitment into an expansion cohort will continue in China until approximately 180 Chinese patients have been randomized.  Identification of China cohort patients will be clearly defined in SAP and by distinct Subject ID Study period In Japan, this study will be started after the confirmation of tolerability of MEDI4736 (1.5 g q4W) + Tremelimumab (75 mg q4W) combination therapy in study D4880C00010 which is currently conducted in Japan. Study design This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multi-center, global Phase III study to determine the efficacy and safety of MEDI4736 monotherapy (1.5 g intravenous [IV] every 4 weeks [q4w]) and MEDI4736 (1.5 g IV q4w) in combination with tremelimumab (75 mg IV q4w) for up to 4 doses/cycle each followed by MEDI4736 (1.5 g IV q4w) versus SoC (cisplatin + gemcitabine or carboplatin + gemcitabine doublet) first-line chemotherapy in treatment-naïve patients with histologically or cytologically documented, unresectable, Stage IV (ie, T4b, any N; or any T, N2-N3; or M1) transitional cell carcinoma (transitional cell and mixed transitional/non-transitional cell histologies) of the urothelium (including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra) and to allow sufficient flexibility for Investigators and patients to select the agents that reflect their normal clinical practice and national guidelines. The patients enrolled in the study will be randomized (1:1:1) to treatment with MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy, MEDI4736 monotherapy, or SoC (cisplatin + gemcitabine or carboplatin + gemcitabine, based on cisplatin eligibility). Crossover from SoC to MEDI4736 monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy will not be permitted.   Patients will be stratified according to cisplatin eligibility (eligible or ineligible), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status (High or Low/Neg, based on Ventana assay), and visceral metastasis (presence or absence of lung and/or liver metastasis).   Tumor assessments will be performed every 8 weeks (q8w; ±7 days) relative to the date of randomization until confirmed disease progression (patients enrolled in the platinum-gemcitabine arm [SoC] will discontinue study drug at the first assessment of disease progression) according to the objective tumor response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).

A further objective to meet China FDA requirement is to evaluate consistency in efficacy and safety among Chinese subjects for benefit-risk assessment of MEDI4736 monotherapy and MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy compared to SoC. Target patient population Adult patients (age ≥18 years) with histologically or cytologically documented, unresectable, Stage IV (ie, T4b, any N; or any T, N2-N3; or M1) transitional cell carcinoma (transitional cell and mixed transitional/non-transitional cell histologies) of the urothelium (including renal pelvis, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra), who have not been previously treated with first-line chemotherapy. Duration of treatment, criteria for retreatment, and treatment through progression Duration of treatment Patients randomized to the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy and the MEDI4736 monotherapy arms will begin treatment on Day 1 until progressive disease (PD) is confirmed, unacceptable toxicity occurs, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met.   According to RECIST 1.1 modified for confirmation of progression, a confirmatory scan will be required following an overall timepoint assessment of progression, preferably at the next scheduled visit and no earlier than 4 weeks after the previous assessment of PD. Patients randomized to treatment in the SoC arm (cisplatin + gemcitabine or carboplatin + gemcitabine) will begin treatment on Day 1 for up to 6 cycles until the first assessment of disease progression or until unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met.   A confirmatory scan will not be required if PD is identified on the SoC arm in order to discontinue treatment; however, a confirmatory scan is required following an overall timepoint assessment of initial progression, even if a subsequent treatment is started, and no earlier than 4 weeks after the previous assessment of PD. Retreatment Patients randomized to the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy arm who meet the retreatment criteria (described below) may receive retreatment 1 time at the Investigator's discretion.   During retreatment, patients will follow the same schedule of assessments as the original treatment period (with the exception of the pharmacokinetics and anti-drug antibody assessments, Hepatitis B and C assessments, and HIV assessments which do not need to be collected a second time): Patients who complete the 4 dosing cycles of the combination of durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab portion of the regimen (with clinical benefit per Investigator judgment) but subsequently have evidence of PD during the durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy portion of the combination regimen, with or without confirmation according to RECIST 1.1, may restart treatment with the combination. Patients who restart treatment after PD must have a baseline tumor assessment within 28 days of restarting treatment with MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy; all further scans will occur q8w (±7 days) relative to the date of randomization until disease progression Criteria for retreatment and treatment through progression Treatment through progression in either the MEDI4736 monotherapy arm, the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy arm, or retreatment in the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy arm are at the Investigator's discretion.   The Investigator will ensure that patients do not have any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible toxicities that indicate that continuing treatment will not provide further benefit to patients.   Moreover, these patients must meet the following specific criteria for treatment in the setting of PD: Written informed consent for retreatment and/or treatment through progression in the setting of PD will specify that treatment beyond evidence of initial PD is not the SoC and that alternative treatment options, including either locally licensed treatments or other clinical trials, are available for this patient population Absence of clinical symptoms or signs (including worsening of laboratory values [eg, new or worsening hypercalcemia]) indicating clinically significant disease progression and no decline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status that can be attributed to disease progression Absence of rapid disease progression or threat to vital organs or critical anatomical sites (eg, central nervous system metastasis or respiratory failure due to tumor compression or spinal cord compression) that cannot be managed by protocol-allowed medical interventions However, a patient in the MEDI4736 monotherapy arm with confirmed disease progression will not be permitted to continue therapy with MEDI4736 if disease progression occurred after confirmed response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR], as defined by RECIST 1.1) in the target lesions.   Additionally, a patient in the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination treatment arm with confirmed disease progression during the combination portion of therapy that occurred after confirmed response (CR or PR, as defined by RECIST 1.1), will not be permitted to continue immunotherapy if disease progression occurred in the target lesions that previously responded to immunotherapy. Retreatment is not permitted for patients in the SoC arm. Patients whom AstraZeneca and the Investigator determine may not continue treatment after PD will enter follow-up.   All patients who have discontinued treatment due to toxicity or symptomatic deterioration, or who have commenced subsequent anticancer therapy, will be followed up until confirmed disease progression and for survival. Investigational product, dosage, and mode of administration MEDI4736 monotherapy MEDI4736 1.5 g via IV infusion q4w, starting on Week 0 MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy MEDI4736 (1.5 g via IV infusion q4w) over a 1-hour period in combination with tremelimumab (75 mg IV q4w) over a 1-hour period for up to 4 doses/cycle each, followed by MEDI4736 (1.5 g IV q4w) until confirmed progression or until other discontinuation criteria are met.   The first MEDI4736 monotherapy dose (1.5 g IV q4w) will be administered 4 weeks after the final dose of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab. Tremelimumab will be administered first; the MEDI4736 infusion will start approximately 1 hour after the end of the tremelimumab infusion.   If there are no clinically significant concerns after the first cycle, then, at the discretion of the Investigator, all other cycles of MEDI4736 can be given immediately after the tremelimumab infusion has finished. SoC Patients eligible for cisplatin will receive 1 of 2 gemcitabine + cisplatin options: IV infusions of cisplatin 70 mg/m2 on Day 2 of each 28-day cycle + gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle, for up to 6 cycles or IV infusions of cisplatin 70 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle + gemcitabine 1000 to 1250 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle, for up 6 cycles Patients in the SoC arm who are ineligible for cisplatin will receive IV infusions of carboplatin with an area under the curve (AUC) of 4.5 to 5 (AUC 4 is permitted only if required by local standard clinical practice) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle + gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle, for up to 6 cycles.  In a rare scenario, if at the Investigator's discretion, patients in the SoC arm who have not progressed continue the SoC treatment beyond 6 cycles, the exposure information will be reported in exposure eCRF and the schedule of assessments beyond 6 cycles will be the same as the one for the treatments within 6 cycles. Statistical methods The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC in terms of overall survival (OS) in patients with unresectable Stage IV urothelial cancer (UC) and to assess the efficacy of MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC in terms of OS in patients with unresectable Stage IV PD-L1-High UC. OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause.   Thus, the co-primary endpoints of this study are OS in patients with UC and OS in patients with unresectable Stage IV PD-L1-High UC.   To control Type I error, the 5% alpha will be split into significance levels of 1.5%, and 3.5% and will be used for the analysis of OS in patients with UC and OS in patients with PD-L1-High UC, respectively.   The study will be considered positive (a success) if either of the OS analysis results (in patients with UC or in patients with PD-L1-High UC) is statistically significant. Secondary efficacy analyses include OS for MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC in patients with UC, OS for MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC in patients with PD-L1-Low/Neg UC, the proportion of patients alive at 24 months from randomization (OS24), progression free survival (PFS), proportion of patients alive and progression-free at 12 months from randomization (APF12), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR), and time from randomization to second progression (PFS2) in the above populations, as well as ORR, DoR, DCR, time to response (TTR), PFS and OS in the MEDI4736 monotherapy treated UC patients who are not eligible for cisplatinbased treatment at baseline (per eCRF).  All tumor assessment-related endpoints will be assessed by Investigator except these defined for the subgroup of MEDI4736 monotherapy treated UC patients who are not eligible for cisplatin-based treatment. Unless otherwise specified, efficacy data will be summarized and analyzed on an intent-totreat (ITT) basis, and the treatment arms will be compared on the basis of randomized treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received.   Patients who were randomized but did not subsequently go on to receive study treatment are included in the ITT population. Approximately 1005 patients will be randomized globally 1:1:1 to MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy, MEDI4736 monotherapy, or SoC.  The randomization will be stratified according to cisplatin eligibility (eligible or ineligible), PD-L1 status (High and/or Low/Neg), and visceral metastases (presence or absence of lung and/or liver metastasis).   PD-L1 status stratification will be based on natural prevalence rates. Randomization of cisplatin-eligible patients will be capped at a maximum 85% of the planned total number of patients. The final analysis of OS will be performed when both of the following are met: Approximately 550 OS events (82% maturity) have occurred across the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy and SoC treatment arms AND Approximately 327 OS events (81% maturity) have occurred in PD-L1-High UC patients treated across the MEDI4736 monotherapy and SoC treatment arms Three interim analyses will be performed.  The first interim (Interim 1) will focus on ORR and DoR in patients who are not cisplatin-eligible and treated with MEDI4736 monotherapy, and the next two will focus on co-primary OS endpoint.  Interim 1 will be conducted when all patients in the global cohort have at least 6 months follow-up. For the co-primary OS endpoint in the ITT population (MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC), 2 interim analyses will be undertaken, and the interim analyses for OS endpoint in the PD-L1-High population (MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC) will be conducted at the same time: The first OS interim analysis (Interim 2) will be conducted when approximately 80% of deaths occur in UC patients treated across the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy and SoC treatment arms AND in  PD-L1-High UC patients treated across the MEDI4736 monotherapy and SoC treatment arms. The second OS interim analysis (Interim 3) will be conducted when approximately 90% of deaths occur in UC patients treated across the MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy and SoC treatment arms AND in  PD-L1-High UC patients treated across the MEDI4736 monotherapy and SoC treatment arms. For the co-primary OS endpoint in the ITT population (MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC), if exactly 80% and 90% of the target events are available at the time of the first and second interim analyses, respectively (ie, 440/550 and 495/550 deaths have occurred), with an overall 2-sided alpha level of 1.5%, the 2-sided alpha to be applied at the OS interim analyses would be 0.56% and 0.8%, and the 2-sided alpha to be applied for the primary OS analysis would be 1.19%. For the co-primary OS endpoint in the PD-L1-High population (MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC), if exactly 80% and 90% of the target events are available at the time of the first and second interim analyses, respectively (ie, 262/327 and 294/327 deaths have occurred), with an overall 2-sided alpha level of 3.5%, the 2-sided alpha to be applied at the OS interim analyses would be 1.58% and 2.01%, and the 2-sided alpha to be applied for the primary OS analysis would be 2.71%. MEDI4736 + tremelimumab versus SoC (OS in all-comers UC) If OS at 12 months was 55% with MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy (with 14.8-month median OS) and 48% with SoC (with 11.3-month median OS) and assuming the true average HR is 0.73, then the trial will have at least 87% power to demonstrate statistical significance at a 2-sided alpha level of 1.19% (with overall alpha for OS of 1.5%) for the comparison of MEDI4736 + tremelimumab combination therapy versus SoC, with the smallest treatment difference that could be statistically significant being an average HR of 0.81.   With a 16-month recruitment period and a minimum follow-up period of 30 months assumed, it is anticipated that this analysis will be performed approximately 46 months after the first patient has been randomized. MEDI4736 versus SoC (OS in PD-L1-High UC) If OS at 12 months was 56% with MEDI4736 monotherapy (with 15.3 month median OS) and 48% with SoC (with 11.3 month median OS) and assuming the true average HR is 0.71, then the trial will have at least 82% power to demonstrate statistical significance at a 2-sided alpha level of 2.71% (with overall alpha for OS of 3.5%) for the comparison of MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC, with the smallest treatment difference that could be statistically significant being an average HR of 0.78.   With a 16-month recruitment period and a minimum follow-up period of 30 months assumed, it is anticipated that this analysis will be performed approximately 46 months after the first patient has been randomized. MEDI4736 versus SoC (OS in all-comers UC) If OS at 12 months was 55% with MEDI4736 monotherapy (with 14.4 month median OS) and 48% with SoC (with 11.3 month median OS) and assuming the true average HR is 0.75, then the trial will have at least 90% power to demonstrate statistical significance at a 2-sided alpha level of 3.83% (with overall alpha for OS of 5%) for the comparison of MEDI4736 monotherapy versus SoC, with the smallest treatment difference that could be statistically significant being an average HR of 0.84.   With a 16-month recruitment period and a minimum follow-up period of 30 months assumed, it is anticipated that this analysis will be performed approximately 46 months after the first patient has been randomized. OS will be analyzed using a stratified log-rank test (stratified for cisplatin eligibility [ie, eligible or ineligible], PD-L1 expression tumor status [High or Low/Neg, for analysis in the ITT population only], and visceral metastasis [presence or absence of lung and/or liver metastasis]).   The effect of treatment will be estimated by the HR together with corresponding ([1-adjusted alpha] × 100%) confidence intervals and p-values. Descriptive statistics will be used for all variables, as appropriate, and will be presented by treatment arm. Safety data Data from all cycles of treatment will be combined in the presentation of safety data.   Adverse events (AEs; both in terms of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms and CTCAE grade) will be listed individually by patient.   The number of patients experiencing each AE will be summarized by treatment arm and CTCAE grade.  Other safety data will be assessed in terms of physical examination, clinical chemistry, hematology, vital signs, and electrocardiograms.   At the end of the study, appropriate summaries of all safety data will be produced, as defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan. China data After the end of global recruitment (i.e.  LSI, globally), recruitment into an expansion cohort will continue in China until approximately 180 Chinese patients have been randomized.  To evaluate consistency, the efficacy and safety data in China cohort will be analyzed separately as required by China FDA, applying the same statistical methods as for global cohort analysis unless specified (refer to Section 8.6 for further details).  Due to patients in the expansion cohort being recruited late, data cut-offs for China cohort analyses may be different from global data cut-off to ensure an appropriate evaluation.  The analysis will be performed when the OS data from the China patients is of similar maturity where significant clinical efficacy is established in the global cohort.  Safety and tolerability will be summarized for the China-only Safety Analysis Set.

          "AdverseEvents": "8.3  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The Principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix H. AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorised representative). The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE.  For information on how to follow up AEs see Section 8.3.2. 8.3.1  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information Adverse events, including SAEs, will be collected from time of signature of the ICF, throughout the treatment period and including the 30-day follow-up period after discontinuation of study drug.  * *In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs/SAEs must be reported. If the investigator becomes aware of a SAE with a suspected causal relationship to the IMP that occurs after the end of the clinical study in a participant treated by him or her, the investigator shall, without undue delay, report the SAE to the sponsor. 8.3.2  Follow-up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  All SAEs/non-serious AEs (as defined in Appendix H), will be followed until resolution, stabilisation, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up. A post-study assessment will be performed preferably within 7 days of the time that the IMP is permanently discontinued. Safety follow-up should be carried out with the participant 30 days (+ 7 days) after the discontinuation of study treatment to follow-up any SAEs/AEs and concomitant medications (including any subsequent cancer therapy). Any AE/SAE/abnormal laboratory findings that are ongoing at the time of study treatment discontinuation or any new treatment related events within 30 days of study treatment, must be followed up to resolution or until the event becomes stable (or returns to baseline) or is unlikely to resolve further in the opinion of the investigator. Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant's last AE assessment or other assessment/visit as appropriate in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF.  AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any participant with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 8.3.3  Adverse Event Variables The following variables will be collected for each AE: AE (verbatim) The date when the AE started and stopped CTCAE grade and changes in CTCAE grade Whether the AE is serious or not Investigator causality rating against the IMP(s) (yes or no) Action taken with regard to IMP(s) AE caused participant's withdrawal from study (yes or no) Outcome. In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: Date AE met criteria for serious AE Date investigator became aware of SAE AE is serious due to Date of hospitalisation Date of discharge Probable cause of death Date of death Autopsy performed Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) Causality assessment to other medication 8.3.4  Causality Collection The investigator should assess the causal relationship between the IMP and each AE, and answer ‘yes' or ‘no' to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?' For SAEs, causal relationship should also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes'. A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix H. 8.3.5  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the participant or reported in response to the open question from the study site staff (eg, ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?'), or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF.  When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 8.3.6  Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests The results from the CSP-mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG abnormalities should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria, are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product or are considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the investigator (which may include but not limited to consideration as to whether treatment or non-planned visits were required or other action was taken with the study treatment, eg, dose adjustment or drug interruption). If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally related to the disease under study (see Section 8.3.8). 8.3.7  Hy's Law Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3xULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN may need to be reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix G for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy's Law. 8.3.8  Disease Progression Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a participant's condition attributable to the disease for which the investigational product is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The development of new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events that are unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an AE during the study. 8.3.9  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational product, or to the study procedure(s)*.  All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. *In Screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting). If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately.  investigators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the EDC system, an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the EDC system is not available, then the investigator or other study site staff reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the investigator/study site staff how to proceed. For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix H. The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness for capivasertib is the current IB; for abiraterone, the local prescribing information is the reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness. 8.3.10  Pregnancy Paternal Exposure Participants should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 16 weeks following the last dose of capivasertib/placebo. Pregnancy of the participants' partners is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until 16 weeks after the last dose should, if possible, be followed up and documented. 8.3.11  Medication Error If a medication error occurs in the course of the study, then the investigator or other site personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is completed within 1 (Initial Fatal/Life-Threatening or follow up Fatal/Life-Threatening) or 5 (other serious initial and follow up) calendar days if there is an SAE associated with the medication error (see Section 8.3.9) and within 30 days for all other medication errors. The definition of a Medication Error can be found in Appendix H 4. 8.3.12  Management of Capivasertib-related Toxicities 8.3.12.1  Capivasertib/Placebo Dose Modification and Guidance Please refer to Section 6.6 for guidance on dose modifications. 8.3.12.2  Dose Modifications due to General Capivasertib-related Toxicities Treatment with capivasertib/placebo should be temporarily interrupted for any intolerable AE regardless of grade or for any AEs grade ≥ 3 that occurs despite optimal supportive care, are not attributable to the disease under investigation, where the investigator considers the AE of concern to be specifically associated with capivasertib.  Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related toxicities are shown in Table 8.  Appropriate and optimal treatment of the toxicity is assumed prior to considering dose modifications.  The Study Physician may be consulted prior to discontinuation of study drug due to toxicities.  Please see Section 8.3.12.3 for the management of capivasertib-specific toxicities including hyperglycaemia, maculo-papular rash and other skin reactions, and diarrhoea.

In participants who are diabetic, it may be beneficial to rule out concomitant aetiologies that could be associated with hyperglycaemia (eg, infections, dehydration, vascular events, glucocorticoids). Participants should be made aware of symptoms of hyperglycaemia (eg, polydipsia and polyuria). Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related hyperglycaemia are shown in Table 9.  In addition, for all grades, participants may receive education on lifestyle changes (eg, a diabetic diet) and consider beginning home glucose monitoring (eg, fasting self-blood glucose monitoring once daily) at the discretion of the investigator.  If glucose home monitoring is instituted, the capivasertib/placebo treatment decision should be based on the morning fasting glucose value obtained prior to the dose of capivasertib/placebo. It is recommended that approaches to the management of capivasertib-induced hyperglycaemia include advice from a diabetologist where appropriate (eg, participants with diabetes).  Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies (see below for further guidance).  If a second agent is required, consideration should be given to the intermittent schedule of capivasertib and the pattern of glucose changes (eg, sulphonylureas should be avoided due to the risk of hypoglycaemia secondary to their mechanism of action).

NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0; SBGM, self-blood glucose monitoring. Use of metformin Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies.  Investigators should exercise caution in the dosing and management of participants receiving the metformin and capivasertib/placebo combination and must be vigilant for signs of renal impairment and metformin toxicity, such as lactic acidosis and hypoglycaemia, namely: lethargy, hypotension, poor urine output, drowsiness, irritation, tachypnoea, sweating, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Due to the potential interaction of metformin and capivasertib (caused by the inhibition of renal transporters [eg, OCT2] involved in the excretion of metformin), when taking both capivasertib and metformin concurrently, participants should attend the clinic for monitoring of serum creatinine at least once per week for the first 3 weeks after initiation of metformin, then every 3 weeks thereafter. Metformin should only be given on the days when capivasertib/placebo is also administered (the half-life of capivasertib is approximately 7 to 15 hours) and should be withdrawn when treatment with capivasertib/placebo is withdrawn, unless otherwise clinically indicated. Consider withholding of metformin on the days when participants are due to have imaging with contrast (in order to reduce the already low risk of lactic acidosis) as per local guidelines. Maculo-papular Rash Dose modifications for capivasertib-related maculo-papular rash, which is the most frequent skin toxicity observed in participants treated with capivasertib, are provided in Table 10.  However, these management guidelines can be used for other skin toxicities at the discretion of the investigator and/or following consultation with the dermatologist.

BSA, body surface area; NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. Hypersensitivity In the case of hypersensitivity reactions, capivasertib/placebo should be discontinued, and symptomatic/supportive therapy should be initiated (including with antihistamines and/or steroids) as considered appropriate by the investigator/treating physician.  Drug re-challenge is not recommended; any subsequent consideration on re-challenge with capivasertib at the same or a lower dose, with its potential for recurrence of such or more severe events should be carefully considered against the potential benefits to the individual participant from continuation of capivasertib therapy and agreed with the sponsor.  Further management should follow local guidelines on management of hypersensitivity reactions. Diarrhoea Participants should be instructed to promptly contact investigators if they develop diarrhoea. Alternative aetiologies should be ruled out prior to initiating the dose modifications.  Investigators are recommended to prescribe anti-diarrhoeal treatment at the first visit so that participants can start treatment at the first sign of diarrhoea, should it occur.  Loperamide is the preferred anti-diarrhoeal agent for the management of diarrhoea occurring in participants participating in studies of capivasertib.  If diarrhoea is reported, additional details regarding this AE will be collected in the eCRF. Dose modifications for capivasertib-related diarrhoea are provided in Table 11.

          "SeriousAdverseEvents": "8.3  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The Principal investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix H. AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorised representative). The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE.  For information on how to follow up AEs see Section 8.3.2. 8.3.1  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information Adverse events, including SAEs, will be collected from time of signature of the ICF, throughout the treatment period and including the 30-day follow-up period after discontinuation of study drug.  * *In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs/SAEs must be reported. If the investigator becomes aware of a SAE with a suspected causal relationship to the IMP that occurs after the end of the clinical study in a participant treated by him or her, the investigator shall, without undue delay, report the SAE to the sponsor. 8.3.2  Follow-up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  All SAEs/non-serious AEs (as defined in Appendix H), will be followed until resolution, stabilisation, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up. A post-study assessment will be performed preferably within 7 days of the time that the IMP is permanently discontinued. Safety follow-up should be carried out with the participant 30 days (+ 7 days) after the discontinuation of study treatment to follow-up any SAEs/AEs and concomitant medications (including any subsequent cancer therapy). Any AE/SAE/abnormal laboratory findings that are ongoing at the time of study treatment discontinuation or any new treatment related events within 30 days of study treatment, must be followed up to resolution or until the event becomes stable (or returns to baseline) or is unlikely to resolve further in the opinion of the investigator. Any AEs that are unresolved at the participant's last AE assessment or other assessment/visit as appropriate in the study are followed up by the investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF.  AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any participant with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 8.3.3  Adverse Event Variables The following variables will be collected for each AE: AE (verbatim) The date when the AE started and stopped CTCAE grade and changes in CTCAE grade Whether the AE is serious or not Investigator causality rating against the IMP(s) (yes or no) Action taken with regard to IMP(s) AE caused participant's withdrawal from study (yes or no) Outcome. In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: Date AE met criteria for serious AE Date investigator became aware of SAE AE is serious due to Date of hospitalisation Date of discharge Probable cause of death Date of death Autopsy performed Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) Causality assessment to other medication 8.3.4  Causality Collection The investigator should assess the causal relationship between the IMP and each AE, and answer ‘yes' or ‘no' to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product?' For SAEs, causal relationship should also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes'. A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix H. 8.3.5  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the participant or reported in response to the open question from the study site staff (eg, ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last asked?'), or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the eCRF.  When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 8.3.6  Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests The results from the CSP-mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG abnormalities should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria, are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the investigational product or are considered to be clinically relevant as judged by the investigator (which may include but not limited to consideration as to whether treatment or non-planned visits were required or other action was taken with the study treatment, eg, dose adjustment or drug interruption). If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s). Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE/SAE. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally related to the disease under study (see Section 8.3.8). 8.3.7  Hy's Law Cases where a participant shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3xULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN may need to be reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix G for further instruction on cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy's Law. 8.3.8  Disease Progression Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a participant's condition attributable to the disease for which the investigational product is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The development of new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events that are unequivocally due to disease progression should not be reported as an AE during the study. 8.3.9  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational product, or to the study procedure(s)*.  All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. *In Screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting). If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life-threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs. For fatal or life-threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately.  investigators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the EDC system, an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the EDC system is not available, then the investigator or other study site staff reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the investigator/study site staff how to proceed. For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix H. The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness for capivasertib is the current IB; for abiraterone, the local prescribing information is the reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness. 8.3.10  Pregnancy Paternal Exposure Participants should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 16 weeks following the last dose of capivasertib/placebo. Pregnancy of the participants' partners is not considered to be an AE.  However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the first dose until 16 weeks after the last dose should, if possible, be followed up and documented. 8.3.11  Medication Error If a medication error occurs in the course of the study, then the investigator or other site personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the investigator to ensure that all relevant information is completed within 1 (Initial Fatal/Life-Threatening or follow up Fatal/Life-Threatening) or 5 (other serious initial and follow up) calendar days if there is an SAE associated with the medication error (see Section 8.3.9) and within 30 days for all other medication errors. The definition of a Medication Error can be found in Appendix H 4. 8.3.12  Management of Capivasertib-related Toxicities 8.3.12.1  Capivasertib/Placebo Dose Modification and Guidance Please refer to Section 6.6 for guidance on dose modifications. 8.3.12.2  Dose Modifications due to General Capivasertib-related Toxicities Treatment with capivasertib/placebo should be temporarily interrupted for any intolerable AE regardless of grade or for any AEs grade ≥ 3 that occurs despite optimal supportive care, are not attributable to the disease under investigation, where the investigator considers the AE of concern to be specifically associated with capivasertib.  Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related toxicities are shown in Table 8.  Appropriate and optimal treatment of the toxicity is assumed prior to considering dose modifications.  The Study Physician may be consulted prior to discontinuation of study drug due to toxicities.  Please see Section 8.3.12.3 for the management of capivasertib-specific toxicities including hyperglycaemia, maculo-papular rash and other skin reactions, and diarrhoea.

In participants who are diabetic, it may be beneficial to rule out concomitant aetiologies that could be associated with hyperglycaemia (eg, infections, dehydration, vascular events, glucocorticoids). Participants should be made aware of symptoms of hyperglycaemia (eg, polydipsia and polyuria). Dose modification guidelines for capivasertib-related hyperglycaemia are shown in Table 9.  In addition, for all grades, participants may receive education on lifestyle changes (eg, a diabetic diet) and consider beginning home glucose monitoring (eg, fasting self-blood glucose monitoring once daily) at the discretion of the investigator.  If glucose home monitoring is instituted, the capivasertib/placebo treatment decision should be based on the morning fasting glucose value obtained prior to the dose of capivasertib/placebo. It is recommended that approaches to the management of capivasertib-induced hyperglycaemia include advice from a diabetologist where appropriate (eg, participants with diabetes).  Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies (see below for further guidance).  If a second agent is required, consideration should be given to the intermittent schedule of capivasertib and the pattern of glucose changes (eg, sulphonylureas should be avoided due to the risk of hypoglycaemia secondary to their mechanism of action).

NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0; SBGM, self-blood glucose monitoring. Use of metformin Metformin is currently the preferred oral antidiabetic recommended for the management of hyperglycaemia occurring in participants in capivasertib studies.  Investigators should exercise caution in the dosing and management of participants receiving the metformin and capivasertib/placebo combination and must be vigilant for signs of renal impairment and metformin toxicity, such as lactic acidosis and hypoglycaemia, namely: lethargy, hypotension, poor urine output, drowsiness, irritation, tachypnoea, sweating, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Due to the potential interaction of metformin and capivasertib (caused by the inhibition of renal transporters [eg, OCT2] involved in the excretion of metformin), when taking both capivasertib and metformin concurrently, participants should attend the clinic for monitoring of serum creatinine at least once per week for the first 3 weeks after initiation of metformin, then every 3 weeks thereafter. Metformin should only be given on the days when capivasertib/placebo is also administered (the half-life of capivasertib is approximately 7 to 15 hours) and should be withdrawn when treatment with capivasertib/placebo is withdrawn, unless otherwise clinically indicated. Consider withholding of metformin on the days when participants are due to have imaging with contrast (in order to reduce the already low risk of lactic acidosis) as per local guidelines. Maculo-papular Rash Dose modifications for capivasertib-related maculo-papular rash, which is the most frequent skin toxicity observed in participants treated with capivasertib, are provided in Table 10.  However, these management guidelines can be used for other skin toxicities at the discretion of the investigator and/or following consultation with the dermatologist.

BSA, body surface area; NCI CTCAE v5, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0. Hypersensitivity In the case of hypersensitivity reactions, capivasertib/placebo should be discontinued, and symptomatic/supportive therapy should be initiated (including with antihistamines and/or steroids) as considered appropriate by the investigator/treating physician.  Drug re-challenge is not recommended; any subsequent consideration on re-challenge with capivasertib at the same or a lower dose, with its potential for recurrence of such or more severe events should be carefully considered against the potential benefits to the individual participant from continuation of capivasertib therapy and agreed with the sponsor.  Further management should follow local guidelines on management of hypersensitivity reactions. Diarrhoea Participants should be instructed to promptly contact investigators if they develop diarrhoea. Alternative aetiologies should be ruled out prior to initiating the dose modifications.  Investigators are recommended to prescribe anti-diarrhoeal treatment at the first visit so that participants can start treatment at the first sign of diarrhoea, should it occur.  Loperamide is the preferred anti-diarrhoeal agent for the management of diarrhoea occurring in participants participating in studies of capivasertib.  If diarrhoea is reported, additional details regarding this AE will be collected in the eCRF. Dose modifications for capivasertib-related diarrhoea are provided in Table 11.

For Exploratory objectives and endpoints, see Section 3 of the CSP. Overall Design This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, global study, designed to compare the efficacy and safety of capivasertib versus placebo, when added to abiraterone (+ prednisone/prednisolone) on a background of ADT in participants with de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC characterised by PTEN deficiency.  PTEN status will be confirmed by investigational IHC testing of tumour tissue at central laboratories.  A participant cannot be randomised until a valid PTEN IHC result indicates PTEN deficiency.  Participants will be recruited globally from approximately 30 countries and approximately 350 study sites in Europe, North America, South America, Australia, and Asia (including China and Japan). Participants will be randomised (1:1 ratio) to receive either capivasertib or matching placebo, in combination with abiraterone (+ prednisone/prednisolone) on a background of ADT.  The randomisation scheme will be stratified on the following factors: Combination of volume of disease according to CHAARTED criteria* and presence of visceral metastases** (ie, high volume disease with visceral metastases/high volume disease without visceral metastases/low volume disease) * High volume (defined as the presence of visceral metastases or ≥ 4 bone lesions with ≥ 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis) versus low volume. ** For the purposes of this study, visceral metastases are defined by the list provided within the IWRS. Geographic location: North America, Western Europe, and Australia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and Asia. Disclosure Statement: This is a parallel-group treatment study with 2 arms that is participant, sponsor, and investigator blinded. Number of Participants: Approximately 5500 participants will be enrolled and screened to achieve a total of 1000 randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 treatment arms.  This is based on the planned number of 331 rPFS events that must be observed for the study to have 90% power to show a statistically significant difference in rPFS at the 2-sided 5% level, assuming a true treatment effect HR of 0.70 (see Section 9.2 for details). For regulatory submission purposes in China, the study will include approximately 150 randomised participants from sites in mainland China and those from Taiwan and Hong Kong accredited by the National Medical Product Administration (NMPA). Note: ‘Enrolled' means a participant's, or their legally acceptable representative's, agreement to participate in a clinical study following completion of the informed consent process.  Potential participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the study, but are not randomly assigned in the study, are considered ‘screen failures', unless otherwise specified by the protocol. Intervention Groups and Duration: Participants will receive oral treatment with capivasertib or matching placebo 400 mg twice daily (BD) 4 days on, 3 days off, until investigator-assessed disease progression by RECIST 1.1 or PCWG3 bone progression criteria, unacceptable toxicity, or the participant requests to stop the treatment.  Participants will also receive the approved oral dose of abiraterone (1000 mg once daily) with 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone daily.  All participants should also receive continuous ADT using either a LHRH agonist, a LHRH antagonist, or bilateral orchiectomy. If either abiraterone or capivasertib/placebo is discontinued prior to disease progression, participants may remain on the other drug at the investigator's discretion until disease progression or evidence of unacceptable toxicity. Data Monitoring Committee: An independent Data Monitoring Committee will assess the progress of the study at regular intervals.  This will include reviewing unblinded safety and tolerability data and the data from the interim efficacy analysis to provide a recommendation to AstraZeneca as to whether the study should continue unchanged, be stopped, or be modified in any way. Statistical Methods: The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be used as the primary population for reporting efficacy data and to summarise baseline characteristics.  This comprises all participants randomised into the study and will be analysed according to randomised treatment regardless of the treatment received (ITT principle).  Any important deviations from randomised treatment will be listed and considered when interpreting the efficacy data.  The Safety Analysis Set will be used as the primary population for reporting safety data.  This comprises all participants randomised into the study who receive at least 1 dose of capivasertib or placebo and will be analysed according to the treatment received.  If a participant receives at least 1 dose of capivasertib they will be included in the capivasertib arm for safety summaries. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy, measured by rPFS, of capivasertib + abiraterone versus placebo + abiraterone, both groups receiving continuous ADT.  The primary endpoint is rPFS in participants who have de novo (newly diagnosed, previously untreated) mHSPC characterised by PTEN deficiency who have received no prior pharmacotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery for metastatic prostate cancer other than that which is permitted by the protocol and may have been administered for a maximum of 3 months from start of ADT to randomisation in the study.  The effect of capivasertib versus placebo will be tested using a log rank test stratified by the randomisation stratification factors.  If there are insufficient events per strata, some strata will be collapsed following rules to be pre-specified in the SAP.  From a stratified Cox proportional hazards model (ties = Efron) the HR (capivasertib + abiraterone versus placebo + abiraterone) together with its corresponding 95% CI will be presented.  A HR < 1 will favour capivasertib + abiraterone. The key secondary endpoints of OS, TFST, SSE-FS, and TTPP will be tested following a MTP to preserve the overall type 1 error (familywise error rate) in the strong sense.  Each endpoint will have its own alpha spending function and will be tested according to the group-sequential Holm variable (GSHv) procedure (Ye et al 2013).  TFST will be analysed at the rPFS interim and final analyses.  OS, SSE-FS, and TTPP will be analysed at the final rPFS analysis and again, approximately 12 months after the final rPFS analysis. The primary endpoint of rPFS (based on investigator assessment using RECIST version 1.1 [soft tissue] and PCWG3 [bone]) will be tested in an interim analysis after 222 (22% maturity) rPFS events have occurred.  With 222 events, a significant result will be declared if the observed rPFS HR is 0.593 or better at this interim analysis with a 2-sided p-value < 0.0001 (approximate relative information fraction = 67%).  The interim analysis on rPFS will be incorporated into the MTP including the key secondary endpoints, which will be analysed using the same methodology specified for the primary endpoint. When the final rPFS analysis is performed it is estimated that approximately 331 (33%) of the 1000 participants will have progressed, according to the definition of rPFS: the time from randomisation to radiographic progression assessed by investigator using RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and/or PCWG3 (bone) criteria, or death. Safety and tolerability data will be summarised using appropriate descriptive statistics. 1.2  Schema Figure 1  Study Design a  High volume is defined as the presence of visceral metastases or ≥ 4 bone lesions with ≥ 1 beyond the vertebral bodies and pelvis (Sweeney et al 2015).

Screening will be conducted in a 2-part process which must be completed within a 3-month period between the participant starting ADT and being randomised to study treatment.  This 3-month period may also include abiraterone treatment.  Screening Part 1 includes testing for PTEN status.  In Part 2, all remaining screening assessments should be performed, and must be completed within 28 days before randomisation.  Screening Part 1 and Part 2 each require a separate ICF.  Participants under screening in Part 2 must be given sufficient time to complete the 7-day BPI-SF and BFI diaries.  Table 2 provides the SoA for the study treatment and follow-up periods. Table 1  Schedule of Assessments (Screening) Screening Part 1 None  1  Schedule of Assessments (Screening) Screening Part 1 a Initial eligibility criteria review for all criteria marked with * in Section 5.1 (inclusion criteria) and Section 5.2 (exclusion criteria). b Bidimensional echocardiogram is the preferred modality because of the global technetium [Tc-99m] shortage (but MUGA can be used alternatively).  The modality of the cardiac function assessments must be consistent within subject ie, if echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment and a follow-up assessment if clinically indicated, then echocardiogram should also be used for subsequent scans.  Participants should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible. c Participants will be required to provide the most recently collected tumour sample (bone metastases or Fine Needle Aspirate [FNA] samples will not be accepted), collected as part of routine clinical practice.  Availability of a tumour sample is mandatory for all patients to enrol in the study for the determination of PTEN status by IHC.  A representative FFPE tissue block that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 6 slides must be provided, or, if not possible to provide a block, at least 6 freshly-cut, unstained, serial tumour slides.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual and Pathology Testing Manual.  In China, 5 slides will be collected for screening Part 1; no additional slides will be collected for screening Part 1 or Part 2. d Optional tumour sample: FFPE block (preferred) or 15 to 20 freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections can be provided.  These slides will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and/ or diagnostic test development.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual and Pathology Testing Manual. e Not applicable for China participants. f Eligible participants (ie, participants for whom PTEN deficiency was detected in tumour sample provided for screening Part 1) are required to provide an additional tumour sample FFPE block (preferred) or 20 (minimum 15) freshly-cut unstained serial tumour tissue sections.  This sample will be used in exploratory biomarker analysis and/or diagnostic test development.  Patients who provided optional tissue in screening Part 1 are exempt from this requirement.  Further details on tissue requirements will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. g Blood sample for determination of PSA.  Mandatory for all participants on study.  Samples to be collected both at screening and at Cycle 1, Day 1. h Tumour assessment will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a whole-body bone scan.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Baseline assessments should be performed no more than 28 days before randomisation, and ideally should be performed as close as possible to the start of study treatment. i BPI-SF and BFI baseline assessments to be completed by the participant in a consecutive 7-day period during screening (only after PTEN deficiency is confirmed) before randomisation (not required to be at site). j In screening Part 1, only SAEs related to study procedures must be reported (AEs do not require reporting).  From screening Part 2 onwards, all AEs/SAEs must be reported.

Cycle (4-week cycles) Cycle (4-week cycles) Cycle (4-week cycles) a Participants will receive the capivasertib recommended oral dose (400 mg twice daily on intermittent schedule [4 days on/3 days off]) or placebo until disease progression or discontinuation. b Participants will also receive the approved dose of abiraterone (1000 mg) as a single oral daily dose on each day of each cycle with 5 mg prednisone or 5 mg prednisolone once daily, until disease progression or discontinuation. c Bidimensional echocardiogram is the preferred modality because of the global technetium [Tc-99m] shortage (but MUGA can be used alternatively).  The modality of the cardiac function assessments must be consistent within participant, ie, if echocardiogram is used for the screening assessment and a follow-up assessment if clinically indicated, then echocardiogram should also be used for subsequent scans.  Participants should also be examined using the same machine and operator whenever possible. d Cycle (4-week cycles) In accordance with the abiraterone prescribing information, serum transaminase levels should continue to be measured monthly throughout treatment with abiraterone (ie, measured at every cycle until discontinuation of abiraterone treatment). e Blood sample for determination of PSA.  Mandatory for all participants on study.  Samples to be collected at screening and C1D1.  PSA progression should be confirmed with a consecutive PSA assessment at least 3 weeks later after each sample collection. f Not applicable for China participants. g Whole blood samples collected for CellSearch CTC assay at pre-treatment on C1D1, pre-treatment on C4D1, and at disease progression. h Whole blood samples collected for EPIC Sciences CTC assay pre-treatment on C1D1, and at disease progression. i Optional matched paired tumour biopsy samples will be collected from consented participants.  A baseline biopsy taken before the initial dosing of study drugs pre-dose on C1D1 (or up to 7 days before C1D1) and an on-treatment biopsy taken between C1D16 and C1D18. j Where possible and with consent, participants may be requested to provide a tumour biopsy at tumour progression. k Tumour assessment will be performed using a CT or MRI scan for soft tissue of chest, abdomen, and pelvis and a whole-body bone scan.  Any other areas of disease involvement should be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual participants.  Follow-up assessments will be performed every 16 weeks (± 14 days) relative to the date of randomisation until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue) and/or PCWG3 criteria (bone), regardless of discontinuation of study treatment (eg, discontinuation due to toxicity or clinical progression) or initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy.  Any other sites at which new disease is suspected should also be appropriately imaged.  If an unscheduled assessment was performed and the participant has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at the participant's scheduled visits.  It is important to follow the imaging assessment schedule as closely as possible; however, tumour assessment can be performed at any time when disease progression is clinically suspected.  For participants who have at least 2 new bone lesions appearing on the first post-baseline scan, confirmation of progression will be required by an additional bone scan showing 2 or more new lesions compared to the first post-baseline bone scan at least 6 weeks later (for further detail please see Appendix E). l For the BPI-SF and BFI, the C1D1 assessment is part of the 7-day diaries completed at screening (see Table 1). m The PRO-CTCAE will only be administered where a linguistically validated version exists for a country. n In addition to regular contacts at 12-week intervals, participants will be contacted in the 7 days following a specified date (data cut-off date) for survival analysis. o Participants will enter the PFS2 follow-up period once the participant has discontinued study treatment due to progressive disease by RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue lesions and/or PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions.  In the survival follow-up period following PFS, all subsequent cancer therapies and vital status will be documented at least every 12 weeks until death, lost to follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first.
