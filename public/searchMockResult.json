    "Endpoints": "Endpoints The primary endpoint of the study is occurrence of DLTs and AEs.",
    "AdverseEvents": "Potential TGF-β-mediated Skin Adverse Events Skin assessments are performed at Screening period and every 6 weeks for all participants per Schedule of Activities (see Section  ). Baseline skin assessments include a detailed medical history of genetic or iatrogenic skin conditions, skin type, significant ultraviolet exposure/sun damage of skin, geographical location, and occupational or environmental exposure to radiation or chemicals. Skin AEs, possibly due to TGF-β inhibition, including hyperkeratosis, KA, and/or cSCC, are important identified risks for bintrafusp alfa.  The distribution of lesions tends to be in sun-exposed areas. Management guidelines for potential TGF-β mediated skin AEs are: Discontinuation or interruption is not required in most cases.  Continuation of treatment should be evaluated by the Investigator. Emollients may continue to be used. Diagnostic and treatment plan should be developed in collaboration between Investigator and dermatologist.  In general, treatment of TGF-β mediated skin lesions such as hyperkeratosis, KA, and cSCC should be based on local guidelines/standard of care.  Lesion evaluation should include excision biopsy of one representative lesion to confirm diagnosis. Treatment and follow-up for KA and cSCC will depend on number and localization of lesions: For single lesions: Full excision may be recommended. In case of multiple lesions or location not suitable for full excision, other treatment options may be offered by the dermatologist, such as: Mohs surgery, cryotherapy, or other standard treatment options depending on the pathology. Use of topical retinoids, if recommended by dermatologist, may be considered after discussion with Medical Monitor. Close clinical follow-up for re-evaluation, resolution, or potential recurrence should be implemented. Spontaneous resolution of KA lesions without surgical intervention has been observed, typically occurring within weeks after discontinuing bintrafusp alfa. The number and localization of lesions, diagnosis (including histopathological diagnosis), treatment, and outcome should be appropriately documented in the eCRF. Consult with Medical Monitor, as needed, for management of TGF-β mediated skin lesions.",
    "SeriousAdverseEvents": "Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The definitions of an AE and a SAE are in Appendix 4. The Investigator and any qualified designees (e.g., Sub-Investigators) are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE.  The Investigator remains responsible for following up AEs that are serious or that caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention or study, as specified in Section  . Requests for follow-up will usually be made via the Study Monitor, although in exceptional circumstances the global patient safety department may contact the Investigator directly to obtain further information or to discuss the event. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Information All SAEs and related nonserious AEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until 12 weeks Safety Follow-up Visit at the time points specified in the Schedule of Activities (Section  ). Beyond this reporting period, any new unsolicited SAEs that the Investigator spontaneously reports to the Sponsor will be collected and processed. All AEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the 28 days Safety Follow-up Visit at the time points specified in the Schedule of Activities (Section  ). All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and under no circumstance will this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 4.  The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available using the same procedure that was used for the initial report. Investigators are not obligated to actively solicit AEs or SAEs after the end of study participation.  However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the Investigator will promptly notify the Sponsor. Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events At each study visit, the participant will be queried on changes in her condition. Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs.  Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are in Appendix 4. Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts.  All SAEs and AESI (as defined in Section  ), will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section  ). Reasonable attempts to obtain this information will be made and documented.  It is also the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that any necessary additional therapeutic measures and follow-up procedures are performed.  Further information on follow-up procedures is in Appendix 4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events Prompt notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor of an SAE (particularly life-threatening and deaths) is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation.  The Sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and Investigators. Individual Case Safety Reports will be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to Investigators, as necessary. An Investigator who receives an Individual Case Safety Report describing a SUSAR or other specific safety information (e.g., Emerging Safety Issue Report, summary or listing of SAEs/SUSARs) from the Sponsor will review and then file it along with the current version of the Investigator Brochure in the Investigator's Site File and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. In this global clinical multicenter study, the Sponsor is in the best position to determine an unanticipated problem (as defined in US Regulations 21 CFR 312.66).  The Sponsor will immediately notify all Investigators of findings that could adversely affect the safety of participants, impact the conduct of the study or alter the IRB's approval/favorable opinion to continue the study.  An unanticipated problem is a serious adverse event that by its nature, incidence, severity, or outcome has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report, specified in Section  . Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study intervention and until the outcome of the pregnancy is known. If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator will inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and will follow the procedures specified below for collection of pregnancy information. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs. Collection of Pregnancy Information Female Participants who become pregnant The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who becomes pregnant while she is in the study.  The initial information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy.  The Investigator will collect follow-up information on the participant and the neonate, and the information will be forwarded to the Sponsor.  Generally, follow-up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date.  Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion (occurring at < 22 weeks gestational age) or stillbirth (occurring at > 22 weeks gestational age) is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any post-study pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study intervention by the Investigator will be reported to the Sponsor as specified in Section  . While the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting. Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will discontinue study intervention or be withdrawn from the study. Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse events of special interest (AESI) are serious or nonserious AEs that are of clinical interest and should be closely followed. For this study, AESI for bintrafusp alfa include the following: Infusion-related reactions including immediate hypersensitivity Immune-related AEs Potential TGF-β-mediated skin AEs Treatment-related anemia Continuous monitoring of such events for bintrafusp alfa is required.  Upon Sponsor's decision, expedited reporting of AESIs in this study is not required, as there is already a high amount of experience with bintrafusp alfa from previous studies of the program.  Infusion-related Reactions Including Immediate Hypersensitivity Infusion-related reactions, including immediate hypersensitivity, are defined in this section.  Infusion-related reactions are AESIs and important identified risks for bintrafusp alfa. Infusion-Related Reactions Infusion-related reactions are defined as any signs or symptoms experienced by participants occurring during or within 1 day of study intervention administration.  An assessment for possible IRR should be triggered based upon the development of specific symptoms within 24 hours of an infusion. These possible IRRs are identified based on a list of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms and criteria based on the timely relationship to an infusion.  Events are divided into reactions versus signs and symptoms: Infusion-related reactions should be considered when onset is on the day of infusion (during or after the infusion) or the day after the infusion (irrespective of resolution date) for IRR, drug hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, hypersensitivity, and Type 1 hypersensitivity. Signs and symptoms of IRR and hypersensitivity/allergic reactions should be considered when onset is on the day of infusion (during or after the infusion) and resolved completely with the end date within 2 days after onset of (but not limited to) pyrexia, chills, flushing, hypotension, dyspnea, wheezing, back pain, abdominal pain, and urticaria. Management of Infusion-Related Reactions Current experience in close to 700 study participants revealed that IRRs to bintrafusp alfa occur seldomly and are generally mild to moderate in severity.  Therefore, administration of a premedication for bintrafusp alfa is generally not required. If an Investigator deems necessary to administer a premedication to a particular participant, an antihistamine (e.g., 25 to 50 mg diphenhydramine) and paracetamol (acetaminophen, 500 to 650 mg intravenously or equivalent oral dose) 30 to 60 minutes prior to bintrafusp alfa infusion is recommended.  Premedication should be administered for subsequent bintrafusp alfa doses based upon clinical judgment and presence/severity of prior infusion reactions.  This regimen may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate provided it does not include systemic corticosteroids. Management of symptoms should follow the guidelines shown in  .

For Grade 3 or 4 IRRs, bintrafusp alfa discontinuation is mandated. For all types and grades of infusion reactions, details about drug physical constitution, method of preparation, and infusion must be recorded. In the event of a Grade 2 IRR that does not improve or worsens after implementation of the treatment modifications indicated in  (including reducing the infusion rate by 50%), the Investigator may consider treatment with corticosteroids and the infusion should be stopped for that day.  At the next infusion, the Investigator may consider the addition of H2 blocker antihistamines (e.g., famotidine), in addition to the above provided recommended optional premedication regimen, for selected participants.  However, prophylactic steroids are not permitted.  At the next dose, if the participant has a second IRR Grade ≥ 2 on the slower infusion rate, with the addition of further medication to premedication, the infusion should be stopped, and the participant should be removed from the study intervention if considered necessary by the Investigator. Hypersensitivity Reaction If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the participant must be treated according to the best available medical practice.  A complete guideline for the emergency treatment of anaphylactic reactions according to the Working Group of the Resuscitation Council United Kingdom and can be found at https://www.resus.org.uk/pages/reaction.pdf.  Participants should be instructed to report any delayed reactions to the Investigator immediately. Symptoms may include, but are not limited to: Impaired airway Decreased oxygen saturation (< 92%) Confusion Lethargy Hypotension Pale/clammy skin Cyanosis. Management of hypersensitivity includes: Epinephrine injection and intravenous dexamethasone Participant should be placed on cardiac, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation monitoring immediately Alert intensive care unit for possible transfer if required. Prophylaxis of Flu-Like Symptoms For prophylaxis of flu-like symptoms, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, e.g., ibuprofen 400 mg or comparable nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug dose, may be administered 2 hours before and 8 hours after the start of each intravenous infusion. Immune-related Adverse Events Immune-related AEs are specific to immunotherapies and vary by organ system.  Immune-related AEs are important identified risks for bintrafusp alfa. In general, the spectrum of irAEs is similar for bintrafusp alfa compared with other checkpoint inhibitors.  Effective risk management of these toxicities (irAEs) primarily caused due to inhibition of PD-L1 and PD-1 pathways is based on key recommendations (Champiat 2016).  Participant education for on-time reporting of symptoms of potential irAEs and prompt clinical assessment is critical for effective management and quicker resolution of immune-mediated toxicities, thus preventing progression into severe forms of toxicity that otherwise may become life-threatening and difficult to manage or warrant permanent discontinuation from the study. The Medical Monitor may be involved as needed for follow-up.  Details of the diagnostic work-up will be requested by the study team. Recommended guidance and management for specific irAEs as provided in the current NCCN guideline available at http://www.nccn.org. According to American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline (Brahmer 2018), treatment of irAEs is mainly dependent upon severity as defined by NCI-CTCAE v5.0.  In general, management by NCI-CTCAE v5.0 grading is listed below: Grade 1: study intervention should be continued with close monitoring, with the exception of some neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac toxicities. Grade 2: study intervention may be suspended for some Grade 2 toxicities, with consideration of resuming when symptoms revert to Grade 1 or less.  Corticosteroids may be administered (initial dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent). Grade 3: study intervention is generally suspended and the high-dose corticosteroids (prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day) treatment should be initiated.  Corticosteroids should be tapered over the course of at least 4 to 6 weeks.  Some refractory cases may require infliximab or other immunosuppressive therapy. Grade 4: in general, permanent discontinuation of study intervention is recommended, with the exception of endocrinopathies that have been controlled by hormone replacement. Permanent treatment discontinuation is required in case of immune-related Grade 4 rash/inflammatory dermatitis, nephritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, aplastic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, and acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. For Grade 4 immune-related lymphopenia, permanent treatment discontinuation will be required, if lymphopenia is considered immune-related in nature, no clear alternative explanation exists for the event, and it does not resolve within 14 days.  Permanent treatment discontinuation is not required when the AE is manifested by a single laboratory value out of normal range without any clinical correlates.  In this case, treatment should be held until the etiology is determined.  If the event is not considered immune-related and resolves to Grade ≤ 1, restarting treatment may be considered. For organ/system specific management guidelines, see the current NCCN guideline available at http://www.nccn.org. Potential TGF-β-mediated Skin Adverse Events Skin assessments are performed at Screening period and every 6 weeks for all participants per Schedule of Activities (see Section  ). Baseline skin assessments include a detailed medical history of genetic or iatrogenic skin conditions, skin type, significant ultraviolet exposure/sun damage of skin, geographical location, and occupational or environmental exposure to radiation or chemicals. Skin AEs, possibly due to TGF-β inhibition, including hyperkeratosis, KA, and/or cSCC, are important identified risks for bintrafusp alfa.  The distribution of lesions tends to be in sun-exposed areas. Management guidelines for potential TGF-β mediated skin AEs are: Discontinuation or interruption is not required in most cases.  Continuation of treatment should be evaluated by the Investigator. Emollients may continue to be used. Diagnostic and treatment plan should be developed in collaboration between Investigator and dermatologist.  In general, treatment of TGF-β mediated skin lesions such as hyperkeratosis, KA, and cSCC should be based on local guidelines/standard of care.  Lesion evaluation should include excision biopsy of one representative lesion to confirm diagnosis. Treatment and follow-up for KA and cSCC will depend on number and localization of lesions: For single lesions: Full excision may be recommended. In case of multiple lesions or location not suitable for full excision, other treatment options may be offered by the dermatologist, such as: Mohs surgery, cryotherapy, or other standard treatment options depending on the pathology. Use of topical retinoids, if recommended by dermatologist, may be considered after discussion with Medical Monitor. Close clinical follow-up for re-evaluation, resolution, or potential recurrence should be implemented. Spontaneous resolution of KA lesions without surgical intervention has been observed, typically occurring within weeks after discontinuing bintrafusp alfa. The number and localization of lesions, diagnosis (including histopathological diagnosis), treatment, and outcome should be appropriately documented in the eCRF. Consult with Medical Monitor, as needed, for management of TGF-β mediated skin lesions. Treatment-related Anemia Treatment-related anemia is an AESI (refer to IB) and important potential risk for bintrafusp alfa.  Notably, there are many reasons for anemia in patients with advanced cancer, due to this a thorough investigation of new anemia cases of unspecified etiology is requested. For new anemia events assessed as treatment-related, items queried may include, but are not limited to, detailed relevant past medical and treatment history, bruising tendency, history of blood transfusions and/or dependency, and a request for an updated eCRF including details such as concomitant medications, all laboratory data, updated dosing information, and recent tumor evaluation scans. General guidance for anemia management and evaluation: Participants must enter the study with hemoglobin values at least 9 g/dL; routine blood test parameters are required in the Schedule of Activities (see Section  ). All relevant hematologic testing for treatment-related anemias should be done prior to a blood transfusion, if clinically feasible. Transfusion should be performed at the discretion of the Investigator based on clinical assessment and considered when the participant experiences significant anemia.  An attempt should be made to initiate work-up (as specified below) for the cause of anemia prior to transfusion, if clinically feasible, to not confound this work-up.  In general, blood transfusions and erythroid growth factors are permitted as clinically indicated. Guidance for evaluation of suspected treatment-related anemias is provided in  .

Other Potential Risks for Bintrafusp alfa Mucosal/Non-tumor Bleeding Mucosal bleeding events of mild to moderate severity were observed in participants treated with bintrafusp alfa in ongoing studies and are a potential risk for bintrafusp alfa.  Events may include epistaxis, hemoptysis, gingival bleeding, or hematuria amongst others.  In general, these reactions resolve without discontinuation of treatment. For Grade 2 non-tumor bleeding, see Section  for general management of Grade 2 treatment-related TEAEs. For Grade 3 non-tumor bleeding, study intervention must be permanently discontinued unless an alternative explanation can be identified (such as concomitant use of antithrombotic agents, traumatic event, etc.).  In case of alternative explanations for the Grade 3 bleeding event, study intervention should be held until the event recovers to Grade ≤ 1. For Grade 4 non-tumor bleeding, treatment must be permanently discontinued if no alternative explanation is identified. Tumor Bleeding For Grade ≥ 2 tumor bleeding, study intervention must be held until the event recovers to Grade ≤ 1.  Treatment should be permanently discontinued if the Investigator considers the participant to be at risk for additional severe bleeding. Alterations in Wound Healing or Repair of Tissue Damage Alterations of wound healing and tissue damage repair are considered an important potential risk (a theoretical risk based on literature findings) for bintrafusp alfa, given the role of TGF-β in wound healing.  Management should be discussed with the Medical Monitor for participants requiring surgery on study.  It is recommended to hold study intervention for approximately 4 weeks post major surgery for observation.  Postoperative wound healing will be closely monitored. Embryofetal Toxicity Embryofetal toxicities are a known risk of the PD-1/PD-L1 targeting class and are considered important potential risks for bintrafusp alfa.  Animal models link the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway with maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue.  Embryofetal toxicity is an important potential risk of bintrafusp alfa.  An appropriate contraception warning is provided as part of the inclusion criteria.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are not allowed in the bintrafusp alfa study, and adequate contraceptive measures are recommended during the study to minimize or eliminate the potential risk to the developing fetus. Respective safety measures to mitigate risks comprise inclusion/exclusion criteria for participation in clinical studies with bintrafusp alfa, guidance for prevention, monitoring, and medical management of potential risks, as well as guidance on study intervention interruption or discontinuation.",

Bintrafusp alfa will be combined with platinum therapy and paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab in participants with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer (Cohort 1A and 1B) or with platinum therapy and definitive radiation in participants with locally advanced cervical cancer (Cohort 2).  Further combination regimens with other anti-cancer therapies may be added by protocol amendment. Bintrafusp alfa monotherapy has demonstrated a manageable safety profile in close to 700 participants and promising efficacy in heavily pretreated participants with advanced cervical cancer in the Phase I Study EMR200647-001.  In addition, the observed safety profile of the combination therapy of bintrafusp alfa with platinum therapy and pemetrexed in participants with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (Study MS200647_0024) and combination therapy of bintrafusp alfa with gemcitabine and cisplatin in participants with first-line biliary tract cancer in a Phase II/III Study (MS200647_0055) did not reveal any new or increased risks compared to what can be expected from current experience, respectively, with chemotherapy and bintrafusp alfa alone. Enhanced antitumor activity has been observed with bintrafusp alfa in combination with chemotherapy regimens or with fractionated, localized radiotherapy in animal models.  In addition, clinical benefit for the combination of checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy and concomitant chemoradiation therapy (cCRT) agents has been demonstrated in various tumor types including lung, head and neck, and renal cell carcinoma.  The combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy may trigger systemic effects by eliciting significant responses in nonirradiated secondary tumors outside the radiotherapy field, known as abscopal effect and therefore enhance clinical efficacy. Bevacizumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, incorporated with chemotherapy increased overall survival and response rates as compared to chemotherapy in participants with advanced cervical cancer. The safety and preliminary efficacy data together with mechanism of action support the investigation of the safety and tolerability of bintrafusp alfa in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer or with chemoradiation followed by bintrafusp alfa in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. Objectives and Endpoints: Objectives Overall Design: This study will be conducted with Cohort 1 (Cohort 1A and Cohort 1B) and Cohort 2 in parallel. The allocation of participants to Cohort 1A or Cohort 1B will be based on Investigator decision and also other factors including but not limited to study inclusion/exclusion criteria and local standard of care. Cohort 1 Participants must have primary Stage IVB, recurrent or persistent squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the cervix not amenable to curative treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy and not have been treated with systemic chemotherapy. Cohort 1A: 8 participants will be treated with bintrafusp alfa (2400 mg every 3 weeks) + cisplatin or carboplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab.  Selection of cisplatin or carboplatin is at the Investigator discretion. Cohort 1B: 8 participants will be treated with bintrafusp alfa (2400 mg every 3 weeks) + cisplatin or carboplatin + paclitaxel.  Selection of cisplatin or carboplatin is at the Investigator discretion. If the first 8 participants of each subcohort separately include fewer than 3 participants from Japan, the Sponsor may elect to continue enrollment to include 3 participants from Japan to evaluate the safety of this combination in Japanese participants.  If the first 8 participants of each subcohort separately include fewer than 3 participants from Europe or the United States, enrollment may continue in Europe and the United States to include at least 3 participants from any of these countries. Cohort 2: Participants with locally advanced cervical cancer will be treated with bintrafusp alfa (2400 mg every 3 weeks) combined with definitive radiation and radiation-sensitizing platinum therapy (cisplatin) during cCRT, followed by maintenance with bintrafusp alfa monotherapy (2400 mg every 3 weeks). If the first 8 participants include fewer than 3 participants from Japan, enrollment may continue in Japan to include at least 3 participants from Japan to evaluate the safety of this combination in Japanese participants.  If the first 8 participants of this cohort include fewer than 3 participants from Europe or the United States, enrollment may continue in Europe and the United States to include at least 3 participants from any of these countries. Disclosure Statement: This is a non-randomized, non-blinded study conducted with Cohorts 1 (Cohort 1A and Cohort 1B) and 2. Number of Arms: 3 cohorts (1A, 1B, and 2) Blinding: No blinding Number of Participants: In total, approximately 24 participants will be enrolled in this study.  For each of the cohorts (1A, 1B, and 2), at least 8 participants will be enrolled to evaluate the safety of each combination treatment. The Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will evaluate the safety in each cohort separately after the 3rd and after the 8th evaluable participant completes the respective dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) period.  In the case more participants are included and complete the DLT period as per enrollment, all the participants will continue to be evaluated by the SMC, if required.  In addition, the SMC will evaluate the safety from all participants as needed. During the DLT observation period, in the event a participant discontinues for reasons other than adverse events (AE) or is otherwise non-evaluable, the Sponsor may elect to add an additional participant. Study Intervention Groups and Duration: The study includes: Up to 28-day Screening period. The DLT observation period of 4 weeks from the Week 1, Day 1 (W1D1) visit for all cohorts. Treatment until progressive disease (PD) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 and subsequent confirmation (at the next imaging visit at least 28 days after the detection of PD) unacceptable toxicity, study withdrawal, or death. In case of PD, treatment may continue if the participant's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status has remained at least stable, and if in the opinion of the Investigator, the participant will benefit from continued treatment, and if other criteria are fulfilled as outlined in the protocol. Cohort 1 participants will continue chemotherapy until complete response (CR) (as clinically indicated) and/or unacceptable toxicity due to chemotherapy, after which, bintrafusp alfa ± bevacizumab (depending on cohort) may be continued until 2 years or unacceptable toxicity as indicated for bintrafusp alfa and/or bevacizumab.  If the Investigator believes that a participant may benefit from treatment beyond 2 years, it may be permissible to continue treatment after discussion with the Medical Monitor and the Sponsor's Medical Responsible. Cohort 2 participants should continue maintenance treatment (bintrafusp alfa) for a maximum of 2 years (at the discretion of the Investigator).  If the Investigator believes that a participant may benefit from treatment beyond 2 years, it may be permissible to continue treatment after discussion with the Medical Monitor and the Sponsor's Medical Responsible. All participants should continue treatment until confirmed disease progression or any other discontinuation criterion is met (e.g., unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent). Safety Follow-up Visits are at 28 days (± 5 days) and 12 weeks (± 2 weeks) after the last dose of study intervention according to the Schedule of Activities. Long-term Follow-up should be performed every 12 weeks (± 2 weeks) after the Safety Follow-up. Survival Follow-up will continue until the end of study.  After the stipulated end of study, Survival Follow-up may continue until the last participant has died or at the discretion of the Sponsor. Involvement of Special Committee(s): Yes The SMC will evaluate the safety (including DLTs) and other available data.  The specific working procedures will be described in an SMC charter.
